philip k. dick
philip k. dick dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short
stories and novels. his stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.
he wrote mainly sf, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than
technology. although he often believed that he had met some sort of god, he
remained sceptical. amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:
""galactic pot-healer""
a fallible alien deity summons a group of earth craftsmen and women to a
remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans. when the
deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer joe fernwright is
unable to comply. a polished, ironic and amusing novel.
""a maze of death""
noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.
""valis""
the schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of gnostic
christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of
unknown but possibly divine origin. he is accompanied by his dogmatic and
dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.
""the divine invasion""
god invades earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from
another star system. unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be
assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.
margaret atwood
""the handmaid's tale""
a story based on the premise that the us congress is mysteriously
assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it
""right"" again. the book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live
under the new christian theocracy. women's right to own property is revoked,
and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the
radio is only used for readings from the bible. crimes are punished
retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the ""old world"" are
hunted down and hanged. atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to
at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.
various authors
""the bible""
this somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized. however, it
is probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is
about. it exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one
true version.

philadelphia, usa.
a detailed and scholarly justification of atheism. contains an outstanding
appendix defining terminology and usage in this (necessarily) tendentious
area. argues both for ""negative atheism"" (i.e. the ""non-belief in the
existence of god(s)"") and also for ""positive atheism"" (""the belief in the
non-existence of god(s)""). includes great refutations of the most
challenging arguments for god; particular attention is paid to refuting
contempory theists such as platinga and swinburne.
541 pages. isbn 0-87722-642-3 (hardcover; paperback also available)
""the case against christianity"", temple university press
a comprehensive critique of christianity, in which he considers
the best contemporary defences of christianity and (ultimately)

james turner
""without god, without creed"", the johns hopkins university press, baltimore,
md, usa
subtitled ""the origins of unbelief in america"". examines the way in which
unbelief (whether agnostic or atheistic) became a mainstream alternative
world-view. focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering france
and britain the emphasis is on american, and particularly new england
developments. ""neither a religious history of secularization or atheism,
without god, without creed is, rather, the intellectual history of the fate
of a single idea, the belief that god exists.""

and writings which, explicitly or implicitly, present the person's philosophy
and world-view. includes obscure (and often suppressed) opinions from many
people. for some popular observations, traces the way in which various
people expressed and twisted the idea over the centuries. quite a number of
the quotations are derived from cardiff's ""what great men think of religion""
and noyes' ""views of religion"".

richard swinburne
""the existence of god (revised edition)"", clarendon paperbacks, oxford
this book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with ""the coherence of
theism"" (1977) and was concluded with ""faith and reason"" (1981). in this
work, swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the
existence of god. his arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely
upon the imputation of late 20th century western christian values and
aesthetics to a god which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were
decisively rejected in mackie's ""the miracle of theism"". in the revised
edition of ""the existence of god"", swinburne includes an appendix in which he
makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut mackie.
j. l. mackie
""the miracle of theism"", oxford
this (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal
arguments for and against the existence of god. it ranges from the classical
philosophical positions of descartes, anselm, berkeley, hume et al, through
the moral arguments of newman, kant and sidgwick, to the recent restatements
of the classical theses by plantinga and swinburne. it also addresses those
positions which push the concept of god beyond the realm of the rational,
such as those of kierkegaard, kung and philips, as well as ""replacements for
god"" such as lelie's axiarchism. the book is a delight to read - less
formalistic and better written than martin's works, and refreshingly direct
when compared with the hand-waving of swinburne.

51060.eml,alt.atheism,"an introduction to atheism
by mathew this article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism. whilst i
have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you
should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint. i
would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some
relevant books are listed in a companion article.
to provide a sense of cohesion and progression, i have presented this article
as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist. all the
questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped
up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created. some other
frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.
please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions
posed from a christian viewpoint. this is because the faq files reflect
questions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly christians
who proselytize on alt.atheism.
so when i talk of religion, i am talking primarily about religions such as
christianity, judaism and islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine
being. much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it
may not.
""what is atheism?""
atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of god.
some atheists go further, and believe that god does not exist. the former is
often referred to as the ""weak atheist"" position, and the latter as ""strong
atheism"".
it is important to note the difference between these two positions. ""weak
atheism"" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of god. ""strong
atheism"" is a positive belief that god does not exist. please do not
fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are ""strong atheists"".
some atheists believe in the non-existence of all gods; others limit their
atheism to specific gods, such as the christian god, rather than making
flat-out denials.
""but isn't disbelieving in god the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?""
definitely not. disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe
it to be true. not believing that something is true is not equivalent to
believing that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or
not. which brings us to agnosticism.
""what is agnosticism then?""
the term 'agnosticism' was coined by professor huxley at a meeting of the
metaphysical society in 1876. he defined an agnostic as someone who
disclaimed (""strong"") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things
must be some cause unknown and unknowable.
thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for
sure whether god exists.
words are slippery things, and language is inexact. beware of assuming that
you can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact
that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic. for example, many people
use agnosticism to mean ""weak atheism"", and use the word ""atheism"" only when
referring to ""strong atheism"".
beware also that because the word ""atheist"" has so many shades of meaning, it
is very difficult to generalize about atheists. about all you can say for
sure is that atheists don't believe in god. for example, it certainly isn't
the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out
about the universe.
""so what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?""
there are many philosophical justifications for atheism. to find out why a
particular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.
many atheists feel that the idea of god as presented by the major religions
is essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that
such a god could exist. others are atheists through scepticism, because they
see no evidence that god exists.
""but isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?""
there are many counter-examples to such a statement. for example, it is
quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than
all other prime numbers. of course, this deals with well-defined objects
obeying well-defined rules. whether gods or universes are similarly
well-defined is a matter for debate.
however, assuming for the moment that the existence of a god is not provably
impossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of
god. if we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to
show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.
if on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in
question is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid
may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing
might be found, to show that it isn't there. such an exhaustive search is
often impractical or impossible. there is no such problem with largest
primes, because we can prove that they don't exist.
therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist
unless we have evidence that they do. even theists follow this rule most of
the time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusively
prove that no unicorns exist anywhere.
to assume that god exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be
tested. we cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere god might be to
prove that he doesn't exist anywhere. so the sceptical atheist assumes by
default that god does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.
those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of god
exists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover
varieties of god described by followers of various religions. so whilst it
may be impossible to prove conclusively that no god exists, it may be
possible to prove that (say) a god as described by a particular religious
book does not exist. it may even be possible to prove that no god described
by any present-day religion exists.
in practice, believing that no god described by any religion exists is very
close to believing that no god exists. however, it is sufficiently different
that counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of
god are not really applicable.
""but what if god is essentially non-detectable?""
if god interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction
must be measurable. hence his interaction with our universe must be
detectable.
if god is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he
does not interact with our universe in any way. many atheists would argue
that if god does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no
importance whether he exists or not.
if the bible is to be believed, god was easily detectable by the israelites.
surely he should still be detectable today?
note that i am not demanding that god interact in a scientifically
verifiable, physical way. it must surely be possible to perceive some
effect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can i distinguish him
from all the other things that don't exist?
""ok, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but
isn't it still a religious belief?""
one of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is ""the
redefinition game"". the cynical view of this game is as follows:
person a begins by making a contentious statement. when person b points out
that it can't be true, person a gradually re-defines the words he used in the
statement until he arrives at something person b is prepared to accept. he
then records the statement, along with the fact that person b has agreed to
it, and continues. eventually a uses the statement as an ""agreed fact"", but
uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure
redefinitions originally needed to get b to agree to it. rather than be seen
to be apparently inconsistent, b will tend to play along.
the point of this digression is that the answer to the question ""isn't
atheism a religious belief?"" depends crucially upon what is meant by
""religious"". ""religion"" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman
controlling power -- especially in some sort of god -- and by faith and
worship. it's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of buddhism are not
""religion"" according to such a definition. atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it
categorized by worship in any meaningful sense. widening the definition of
""religious"" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of
human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as ""religious"" as well -- such as
science, politics, and watching tv.
""ok, so it's not a religion. but surely belief in atheism (or science) is
still just an act of faith, like religion is?""
firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one
actually believes in.
secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to
make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience. most atheists
try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to
questioning if experience throws them into doubt.
science has a number of core assumptions. for example, it is generally
assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers. these are
the sort of core assumptions atheists make. if such basic ideas are called
""acts of faith"", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on
acts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.
faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.
according to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of
faith. of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as
religious followers when claiming that something is ""certain"". this is not a
general tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to
state with certainty that the universe exists.
faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.
sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheism
has no beliefs. strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, as
even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or
the lack of it) when asserting that god does not exist.
""if atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?""
it is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either ""for"" or
""against"", ""friend"" or ""enemy"". the truth is not so clear-cut.
atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,
it can be said to be ""anti-religion"". however, when religious believers
speak of atheists being ""anti-religious"" they usually mean that the atheists
have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.
this categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.
atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.
most atheists take a ""live and let live"" attitude. unless questioned, they
will not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends. of
course, this may be in part because atheism is not ""socially acceptable"" in
many countries.
a few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to ""convert"" others
when possible. historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little
impact on society outside the eastern bloc countries.
(to digress slightly: the soviet union was originally dedicated to separation
of church and state, just like the usa. soviet citizens were legally free to
worship as they wished. the institution of ""state atheism"" came about when
stalin took control of the soviet union and tried to destroy the churches in
order to gain complete power over the population.)
some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see
religion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,
the government of the usa. such individuals are usually concerned that
church and state should remain separate.
""but if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,
surely that's the same as state atheism?""
the principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall
not legislate concerning matters of religious belief. in particular, it
means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of
another, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in
nature.
religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters. for
example, religious believers have historically been responsible for
encouraging many political reforms. even today, many organizations
campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as
religious campaigns. so long as they campaign concerning secular matters,
and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists
are quite happy to see them have their say.
""what about prayer in schools? if there's no god, why do you care if people
pray?""
because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things
that those who don't pray can't just ignore. also, christian prayer in
schools is intimidating to non-christians, even if they are told that they
need not join in. the diversity of religious and non-religious belief means
that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be
acceptable to all those present at any public event.
also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray. it is reasonable
to care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other
motives.
""you mentioned christians who campaign for increased foreign aid. what about
atheists? why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals? don't
atheists object to the religious charities?""
there are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can
contribute to. some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for
the sake of the practical good they do. some atheists even do voluntary work
for charities founded on a theistic basis.
most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about in
connection with charity. to them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday
matter, and so is charity. many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to say
self-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set
of religious beliefs.
to ""weak"" atheists, building a hospital to say ""i do not believe in god"" is a
rather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say ""today is not my
birthday"". why the fuss? atheism is rarely evangelical.
""you said atheism isn't anti-religious. but is it perhaps a backlash against
one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?""
perhaps it is, for some. but many people have parents who do not attempt to
force any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people
choose to call themselves atheists.
it's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a
backlash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different. on the
other hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the
expectations of others.
on the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion are
backlash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go
along with a group rather than act or think independently.
""how do atheists differ from religious people?""
they don't believe in god. that's all there is to it.
atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a
verdi requiem, even if they know the words. they may wear hawaiian shirts,
they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes. (many
buddhists lack a belief in any sort of god.) some atheists even carry a copy
of the bible around -- for arguing against, of course!
whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without
realising it. atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and
appearance.
""unexceptional? but aren't atheists less moral than religious people?""
that depends. if you define morality as obedience to god, then of course
atheists are less moral as they don't obey any god. but usually when one
talks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (""right"") and unacceptable
(""wrong"") behaviour within society.
humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must
co-operate with each other. this is a good enough reason to discourage most
atheists from ""anti-social"" or ""immoral"" behaviour, purely for the purposes
of self-preservation.
many atheists behave in a ""moral"" or ""compassionate"" way simply because they
feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans. so why do they care
what happens to others? they don't know, they simply are that way.
naturally, there are some people who behave ""immorally"" and try to use
atheism to justify their actions. however, there are equally many people who
behave ""immorally"" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their
actions. for example:
""here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: jesus christ
came into the world to save sinners... but for that very reason, i was
shown mercy so that in me... jesus christ might display his unlimited
patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive
eternal life. now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only god,
be honor and glory forever and ever.""
the above quote is from a statement made to the court on february 17th 1992
by jeffrey dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of milwaukee,
wisconsin. it seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a
religious mass-murderer. but what of more trivial morality?
a survey conducted by the roper organization found that behavior
deteriorated after ""born again"" experiences. while only 4 of respondents
said they had driven intoxicated before being ""born again,"" 12 had done
so after conversion. similarly, 5 had used illegal drugs before
conversion, 9 after. two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex
before salvation; 5 after. ""freethought today"", september 1991, p. 12. so it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral
behaviour.
""is there such a thing as atheist morality?""
if you mean ""is there such a thing as morality for atheists?"", then the
answer is yes, as explained above. many atheists have ideas about morality
which are at least as strong as those held by religious people.
if you mean ""does atheism have a characteristic moral code?"", then the answer
is no. atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person
will behave. most atheists follow many of the same ""moral rules"" as theists,
but for different reasons. atheists view morality as something created by
humans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, rather
than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.
""then aren't atheists just theists who are denying god?""
a study by the freedom from religion foundation found that over 90 of the
atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for
them. they had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible
with what they observed around them.
atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are
unbelievers through choice. the vast majority of them have spent time
studying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth. they have
made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.
this decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that
individual's personality. for a naturally sceptical person, the choice
of atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only
choice that person can honestly make.
""but don't atheists want to believe in god?""
atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them. many
of them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the
""big brother"" figure might be.
some atheists would like to be able to believe in god -- but so what? should
one believe things merely because one wants them to be true? the risks of
such an approach should be obvious. atheists often decide that wanting to
believe something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.
""but of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of god -- they are
unwilling in their souls to see!""
many, if not most atheists were previously religious. as has been explained
above, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that god
exists. many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach god.
of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that
all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.
comments such as ""of course god is there, you just aren't looking properly""
are likely to be viewed as patronizing.
certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is
vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are
being sincere if they say that they have searched for god. if you are not
willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is
futile.
""isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?""
many atheists live a purposeful life. they decide what they think gives
meaning to life, and they pursue those goals. they try to make their lives
count, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other
people who will live on. for example, an atheist may dedicate his life to
political reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.
it is a natural human tendency to look for ""meaning"" or ""purpose"" in random
events. however, it is by no means obvious that ""life"" is the sort of thing
that has a ""meaning"".
to put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually
a sensible thing to ask. some atheists believe that asking ""what is the
meaning of life?"" is as silly as asking ""what is the meaning of a cup of
coffee?"". they believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.
""so how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?""
there are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.
or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or tv.
that may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so
what? should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or
should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?
in the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned. most atheists are
unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because
it makes them feel comfortable. they put truth before comfort, and consider
that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's just
hard luck.
""don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?""
the short answer is ""no, do you?""
many atheists have been atheists for years. they have encountered many
arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of god, but they have
found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.
thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof of
the existence of god. atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely
to be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.
""so why should theists question their beliefs? don't the same arguments
apply?""
no, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar. weak atheism is
the sceptical ""default position"" to take; it asserts nothing. strong atheism
is a negative belief. theism is a very strong positive belief.
atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs
because of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,
but to everyone else.
""what sort of harm?""
religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind. it's not
just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;
think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.
imagine how that effort could be better spent.
many theists believe in miracle healing. there have been plenty of instances
of ill people being ""healed"" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines
prescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result. some theists have died
because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.
it is arguable that the catholic church's opposition to birth control -- and
condoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many
third-world countries and contributing to the spread of aids world-wide.
religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than
allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different
religion.
""those weren't real believers. they just claimed to be believers as some
sort of excuse.""
what makes a real believer? there are so many one true religions it's hard
to tell. look at christianity: there are many competing groups, all
convinced that they are the only true christians. sometimes they even fight
and kill each other. how is an atheist supposed to decide who's a real
christian and who isn't, when even the major christian churches like the
catholic church and the church of england can't decide amongst themselves?
in the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who
calls himself a christian, and uses christian belief or dogma to justify his
actions, should be considered a christian. maybe some of those christians
are just perverting christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if
the bible can be so readily used to support un-christian acts it can't be
much of a moral code? if the bible is the word of god, why couldn't he have
made it less easy to misinterpret? and how do you know that your beliefs
aren't a perversion of what your god intended?
if there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the bible, then why
should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?
sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in jesus and that he murdered
others because jesus and the bible told him to do so, we must call him a
christian.
""obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned. but since
nobody has ever proved that god does not exist, it must be very unlikely
that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.""
that does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,
positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much
harder to disprove than negative ones. nobody has ever proved that unicorns
don't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.
it is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than
it is to hold a positive assertion by default. of course, ""weak"" atheists
would argue that asserting nothing is better still.
""well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?""
unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how ""correct""
it is, or whether it ""works""; consider how many people believe in astrology,
graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.
many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in
gods. certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the
people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.
of course, there's more to religion than that. in the industrialized world,
we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when
there are perfectly adequate natural explanations. religion may have started
as a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other
purposes as well.
""but so many cultures have developed religions. surely that must say
something?""
not really. most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it's
worth remembering that religions such as buddhism and taoism lack any sort of
concept of god in the christian sense.
of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it's
rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.
""what about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded
that god exists?""
for every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who
does not. besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is
not determined by how many people believe it. also, it is important to
realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the
same way that theists view their religious leaders.
a famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but
when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight. many
respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on
subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.
""so are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates
nothing?""
not entirely. it certainly indicates that the religion in question has
properties which have helped it so spread so far.
the theory of memetics talks of ""memes"" -- sets of ideas which can propagate
themselves between human minds, by analogy with genes. some atheists view
religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by
encouraging their hosts to convert others. some memes avoid destruction by
discouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure
to keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken. some
religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by
other memes.
of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with
successful propagation of a meme. religion is not a good thing because of
the number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing
because of the number of people who have caught it.
""even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important
messages. what are the fundamental messages of atheism?""
there are many important ideas atheists promote. the following are just a
few of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some
religions.
there is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.
be especially sceptical of positive claims.
if you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to
find it.
search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.
make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.
it's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change
yourself.
just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.
if you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.
don't believe things just because you want them to be true.
and finally (and most importantly):
all beliefs should be open to question.

51119.eml,alt.atheism,"the argument goes as follows: q-oid quotes appear in john, but not in
the almost codified way they were in matthew or luke. however, they are
considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of q as such, and
not an entirely different source.
we are talking date of texts here, not the age of the authors. the usual
explanation for the time order of mark, matthew and luke does not consider
their respective ages. it says matthew has read the text of mark, and luke
that of matthew (and probably that of mark).
as it is assumed that john knew the content of luke's text. the evidence
for that is not overwhelming, admittedly.
when they are from about 200, why do they shed doubt on the order on
putting john after the rest of the three?
sure, an original together with id card of sender and receiver would be
fine. so what's that supposed to say? am i missing something?
that john was a disciple is not generally accepted. the style and language
together with the theology are usually used as counterargument.
the argument that john was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospel
of john itself. is there any other evidence for it?
one step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. compare that
to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies.
not even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources.
in other words, one does not know what the original of mark did look like
and arguments based on mark are pretty weak.
but how is that connected to a redating of john?

take your foot out of your mouth, i wondered about that already when i
was a catholic christian. the fact that the contradiction is unresolvable
is one of the reasons why i am an atheist.
believe me, i believed similar sentences for a long time. but that shows
the power of religion and not anything about its claims.
it follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used. letting evil
happen or allowing evil to take place, in this place even causing evil,
is another evil.
the omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do even
before the omnipotent has created them. there is no choice left. all is known,
the course of events is fixed.
not even for the omniscient itself, to extend an argument by james tims.
and when i am not omnipotent, how can i have free will? you have said
something about choices and the scenario gives them. therefore we have
what you define as free will.
imagine the following. i can do good to other beings, but i cannot harm them.
easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good
deeds, but don't make them long for them, so they can not feel the absence
of good as evil.
but whose case am i arguing? it is conceivable, so the omnipotent can do it.
or it would not be omnipotent. if you want logically consistent as well, you
have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first.
(deletion)
that the bible describes an omniscient and omnipotent god destroys
the credibility of the bible, nothing less.
and a lot of people would be interested in evidence for a god,
unfortunately, there can't be any with these definitions.

benedikt"
51125.eml,alt.atheism,"... yes.
well, for example, the goal of ""natural"" morality is the survival and
propogation of the species. another example of a moral system is
presented within the declaration of independence, which states that we
should be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. you see,
to have a moral system, we must define the purpose of the system. that is,
we shall be moral unto what end?
well, murder violates the golen rule, which is certainly a pillar of most
every moral system. however, i am not assuming that our current system
and the manner of its implementation are objectively moral. i think that
it is a very good approximation, but we can't be perfect.
well, ""objective"" would assume a system based on clear and fundamental
concepts, while ""arbitary"" implies no clear line of reasoning.

51130.eml,alt.atheism,"that's right, and this is pretty impossible, right? it would be ideal if
we could believe for a while, just to try out religion, and only then
determine which course of thought suits us best. but again, this is not
possible. not that religion warrants belief, but the belief carries with
it some psychological benefits. there are also some psychological
burdens, too.
well, if there were some psychological or other benefits gained from racism,
they could only be fully understood or judged by persons actually ""believing""
in racism. of course, the parallel happens to be a poor one, but you
originated it.
keith"
51131.eml,alt.atheism,"yes, and everyone thinks as you do. no one thinks that he is going to cause
or be involved in a fatal accident, but the likelihood is surprisingly high.
just because you are the man on the firing squad whose gun is shooting
blanks does not mean that you are less guilty.
you mean that killing is wrong in all but one situtation? and, you should
note that that situation will never occur. there are always other options
thank killing. why don't you just say that all killing is wrong. this
is basically what you are saying.
are you attempting to be condescending?
but, most people have found the risk to be acceptable. you are probably
much more likely to die in a plane crash, or even using an electric
blender, than you are to be executed as an innocent. i personally think
that the risk is acceptable, but in an ideal moral system, no such risk
is acceptable. ""acceptable"" is the fudge factor necessary in such an
approximation to the ideal.
keith"
51132.eml,alt.atheism,"are we talking about me, or the majority of the people that support it?
anyway, i think that ""revenge"" or ""fairness"" is why most people are in
favor of the punishment. if a murderer is going to be punished, people
that think that he should ""get what he deserves."" most people wouldn't
think it would be fair for the murderer to live, while his victim died.
perhaps you think that it is petty and pathetic, but your views are in the
minority.
where are we required to have compassion, forgiveness, and sympathy? if
someone wrongs me, i will take great lengths to make sure that his advantage
is removed, or a similar situation is forced upon him. if someone kills
another, then we can apply the golden rule and kill this person in turn.
is not our entire moral system based on such a concept?
or, are you stating that human life is sacred, somehow, and that it should
never be violated? this would sound like some sort of religious view.
once a criminal has committed a murder, his desires are irrelevant.
and, you still have not answered my question. if you are concerned about
the death penalty due to the possibility of the execution of an innocent,
then why isn't this same concern shared with imprisonment. shouldn't we,
by your logic, administer as minimum as punishment as possible, to avoid
violating the liberty or happiness of an innocent person?
keith"
51133.eml,alt.atheism,"why are only those people in favor of the system to blame. if society
accepts such a system, then each member of society is to blame when
an innocent person gets executed. those that are not in favor should
work to convince others.
and, most members of our society have accepted the blame--they've considered
the risk to be acceptable. similarly, every person who drives must accept
the blame for fatal traffic accidents. this is something that is surely
going to happen when so many people are driving. it is all a question of
what risk is acceptable. it is much more likely that an innocent person
will be killed driving than it is that one will be executed.
keith"
51142.eml,alt.atheism,"well, i've said that when an innocent person has been executed, this is
objectively a murder. however, who is at blame is another question.
it seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions--
realizing the risks--is to blame.
yes, but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing
any raondom activity. presumably, you had not isolated yourself totally
from the rest of society because of this.
and i argue that our law system is a similar risk. perhaps an innocent
person will be punished someday, but we work to prevent this. in fact,
many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment
of innocents.
but, such accidents are to be totally expected, given the numner of vehicals
on the road. again, the blame is on society.
yes, but the state is not at fault in such a case. the state can only do
so much to prevent false witnesses.
okay, so this is what you call murder. but, the question is whether or not
all such ""murders"" are wrong. are you saying that all taking of human life
is wrong, no matter what the circumstances?
but, this is basically how it works. society accepts the risk that an
innocent person will be murdered by execution. and, every member of
society shares this blame. and, most people's definitions of murder
include some sort of malicious intent, which is not involved in an
execution, is it?
murder violates the golden rule. executions do not, because by allowing
it at all, society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the
innocent victim is.
reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction
was moral or not. but, in an objective system, only the absolute truth
matters, and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth. that
is, twelve members must be convinced of a truth.
but then, if we read the minds of these people, we would know that the
conviction was unfair.
yes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all
possible information), we can't always determine the difference in our
flawed system. i think that our system is almost as good as possible,
but it still isn't objectively perfect. you see, it doesn't matter if
we know it is fair or not. objectively, it is either fair or it is not.
but what we know has no effect on an objective system.
why are you so sure?
why is your reality important?
but, we can assume that the system is fairly decent, at least most likely.
and, you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a
totally ideal and objective system.
well, we can have an ideal system, but the working system can not be ideal.
we can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to
the ideal system as possible.
yes, we all bear the responsibility. most people seem willing to do this.
we must realize the consequences of all our actions. why do you keep
separating the justice system from the pack?
i don't think our country has an objective system, but i think such an
objective system can exist, in theory. without omniscience, an objective
system is not possible in practice.

""birth announcement"" on march 7, 1993, from earth forum, compuserve
information service formal announcement
(sm)
enviroleague
a new youth movement,""enviroleague,"" was recently born, according to its
founder, boyd r. critz, iii (cis id 71611,365), of peoria, illinois.
enviroleague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in
matters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our
environment.
incorporated as an illinois not-for-profit corporation, its articles and
initial applications for a service mark have now been filed. according to
critz, its draft bylaws contain the following statement of mission and
objectives:
mission
it is the mission of enviroleague and its adult members
to foster and implement the improved education of young
people in the need to conduct their lives as stewards
of the earth, to leave the earth in a better condition
than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,
moral and ethical users of their environment. to pursue
the accomplishment of this mission, enviroleague shall
seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the
separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,
improvement, and responsible use of the environment in
which we must all live.
objectives
in pursuit of the mission of enviroleague, its primary
objectives shall be:
(1) to establish a movement involving as many
environmentally concerned organizations as
possible, said movement having as its primary
focus the education and participatory
involvement of young people in appropriate areas
of environmental concern;
(2) to develop and provide to such organizations and
their branches a full complement of program
materials for their use, including suitable
uniforms, insignia and other badges, written
ideas, syllabi and information, literature and
other items as shall seem appropriate and
desirable;
(3) to serve as a ""clearing house"" for the exchange
of program ideas, materials and information
among said organizations; and
(4) to assist environmentally concerned
organizations to recruit and train the necessary
adult leadership for their youth programs.
enviroleague will operate through three ""program divisions"" serving youth in
the elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively. service shall be
through formation of ""enviroleague teams,"" either by enviroleague itself or by
environmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a
charter to use programs developed by enviroleague.
enviroleague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders
of each local team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to
membership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper
conduct. organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain
additional standards for their own use of the program material. should such
organizations do so, enviroleague will commit itself to forming, as soon as
possible, new nearby teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to
youth membership.
enviroleague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to
contribute to developing its programs. thus, the top youth leaders of its
teams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any
local administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be
involved in similar functions at the national level.
program materials are in development at this time. copies of the ""draft""
portions of the mentor's manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the
earth forum, library 17. these files will be updated as development takes
place.
compuserve is particularly proud that enviroleague's founder chose this
electronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation.
this announcement is being made simultaneously in both the outdoor and earth
forums.
the electronic home of enviroleague is in compuserve's earth forum - go
earth - message and library areas 17, both named ""enviroleague."" subsequently, enviroleague's initial governance council has held its first
meeting. boyd critz was elected as the first enviroleague chief guardian
(equivalent to chairman of the board or ceo). he can be reached at home
(309) 675-4483 in case of real need. also, mail can be addressed to:

51152.eml,alt.atheism,"also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a
higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking. the
typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the
same inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the
other, qualitatively. but then again a measuring stick must be drawn
somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core,
than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it
expresses its own selfishness.
idle thoughts...
adam adam john cooper ""verily, often have i laughed at the weaklings who thought themselves good simply because they had no claws."""
51153.eml,alt.atheism,"let me first say that ""to believe that no gods exist"" is in fact
different than ""not believing in a god or gods"".
i will argue that your latter statement, ""i believe that no gods exist""
does rest upon faith - that is, if you are making a positive statement
that ""no gods exist"" (strong atheism) rather than merely saying i don't
know and therefore don't believe in them and don't not believe in then
(weak atheism). once again, to not believe in god is different than saying
i believe that god does not exist. i still maintain the position, even
after reading the faqs, that strong atheism requires faith.
but first let me say the following.
we might have a language problem here - in regards to ""faith"" and
""existence"". i, as a christian, maintain that god does not exist.
to exist means to have being in space and time. god does not have
being - god is being. kierkegaard once said that god does not
exist, he is eternal. with this said, i feel it's rather pointless
to debate the so called ""existence"" of god - and that is not what
i'm doing here. i believe that god is the source and ground of
being. when you say that ""god does not exist"", i also accept this
statement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. however,
in what follows i will use the phrase ""the existence of god"" in it's
'usual sense' - and this is the sense that i think you are using it.
i would like a clarification upon what you mean by ""the existence of
god"".
we also might differ upon what it means to have faith. here is what
webster says:
faith
1a: allegiance to duty or a person: loyalty
b (1): fidelity to one's promises
(2): sincerity of intentions
2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to god
(2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion
b (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof (2): complete trust
3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system of religious beliefs
syn see belief
one can never prove that god does or does not exist. when you say
that you believe god does not exist, and that this is an opinion
""based upon observation"", i will have to ask ""what observtions are
you refering to?"" there are no observations - pro or con - that
are valid here in establishing a positive belief. all observations
can only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even
be predisposed to (by predisposed i mean, for example, people whoes
partents ""believe in god"" also tend to). to actually draw a conclusion
about the ""existence"" or ""non-existence"" of god requires a leap - and
you have made this leap when you actively say ""i believe that god
does does not exist"". personally, i think that both statements are
misguided. arguing over the ""existence"" of god is precisely the wrong way
to find him (and yes, i use ""him"" because a personal god is the only
viable concept (imo) - if a person wants to use ""she"" go ahead. of course
god is neither he nor she - but we have no choice but to
anthropomorphise. if you want me to explain myself further i'll be

51156.eml,alt.atheism,"i think you mean circular, not recursive, but that is semantics.
recursiveness has no problems, it is just horribly inefficient (just ask
any assembly programmer.)
the oft-quoted line that says people should be guaranteed life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights, is a complete lie
and deception, as the very authors of that line were in the process of
proving. liberty is never free, it is always purchased at some cost,
almost always at the cost to another. whos liberty is more inalienable?
similarly for right of life. when one person must die if he is to save
another, or even a group of others, whos life is more inalienable?
that leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty,
especially for serial killers. whos life and liberty is more valuable,
the serial killer, or the victim? according to that beautiful line,
those two rights should be completely inviolate, that is, noone should be
able to remove them. this includes government. admittedly the serial
killer has restricted some people's life and or liberty, but is not his
own life liberty inviolate also? according to the declaration of independence,
it is.
oooh, i like that. it means that killing an infant is not murder because
it cannot be against its will. reason, an infant has no will as such.
similarly for people who are brain dead (easier to see), in a coma, etc.
also, under current law, accidental killing is still murder. how will you
include that?
the only real golden rule in life is, he who has the gold, makes the
rules. i.e. might makes right. that is survival. now what is wrong
with that?

51162.eml,alt.atheism,"well, i'd say that a murderer is one who intentionally committed a murder.
for instance, if you put a bullet into a gun that was thought to contain
blanks, and someone was killed with such a gun, the person who actually
performed the action isn't the murderer (but i guess this is actually made
clear in the below definition).
what do you mean by ""reasonable?"" ... yes, it is bad to include the word being defined in the definition. but,
even though the series is recursively infinite, i think the meaning can
still be deduced. math lesson deleted okay, let's look at this situation: suppose there is a longstanding
feud between two families which claim that the other committed some
travesty in the distant past. each time a member of the one family
kills a member of the other, the other family thinks that it is justified
in killing a that member of the first family. now, let's suppose that this
sequence has occurred an infinite number of times. or, if you don't
like dealing with infinities, suppose that one member of the family
goes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing. that is, there
is a never-ending loop of slayings based on some non-existent travesty.
how do you resolve this?
well, they are all murders.
now, i suppose that this isn't totally applicable to your ""problem,"" but
it still is possible to reduce an uninduced system.
and, in any case, the nested ""murderer"" in the definition of murder
cannot be infintely recursive, given the finite existence of humanity.
and, a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved. so, the
first person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily
a murderer. is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently
unreducable definition? see, in a totally objective system where all the
information is available, such a nested definition isn't really a problem.

51165.eml,alt.atheism,"i hope i gave you a fairly solid answer to this one: i simply don't agree with the embodied version of a satan who is a separate creation or a force. and there are quite physical descriptions of heaven and hell in the holy qur'an, the bible, etc. there have been times in the spiritual and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical descriptions of heaven, hell, and satan were taken quite literally and that worked for the time. as i mentioned in the tradition cited above, for example, it was sufficient in the absence of a theory about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the ""evil"" which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as ""satanic.""
which begs the question: if satan in this case is
metaphorical, how can you be certain allah is not
the same way? the bottom line here, however, is that describing a spiritual plane in human language is something like describing ""color"" to a person who has been blind from birth. you may want to read the book flatland (if you haven't already) or the dragon's egg. the first is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con- cept... some deleted for space saving when language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers, then such conventions as metaphor, allegory, and the like come to be necessary. the ""unseen"" is described in terms which have reference and meaning for the reader listener. but, like all models, a compro- mise must be made when speaking metaphorically: clarity and directness of meaning, equivalence of perception, and the like are all crippled. but what else can you do?
this is why i asked the above. how would you then
know god exists as a spirit or being rather than
just being metaphorical? i mean, it's okay to say
""well, satan is just metaphorical,"" but then you
have to justify this belief and justify that god is
not some metaphor for something else.
i say this because there are many, many instances of
satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in
the old testament book of job, or the temptor in the
new testament gospels). in the same way, god too is
described as a being (or spirit.) how am i to know
one is metaphorical and not the other.
further, belief in god isn't a bar to evil. let's
consider the case of satanists: even if satan were
metaphorical, the satanist would have to believe
in god to justify this belief. again, we have a
case where someone does believe in god, but by
religious standards, they are ""evil."" if bobby

consistent, but all the evidence that i am familiar with not only does
not support it, but indicates something far different. the earth, by
latest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for
about 3.5 billion of those years. humans have only been around for (at
most) about 200,000 years. but, the fossil evidence inidcates that life
has been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before
there were people. (yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease...
mostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) heck, not just
fossil evidence, but what we've been able to glean from genetic study shows
that disease has been around for a long, long time. if human sin was what
brought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then
how could it exist before humans? deletions uh... i know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more about
biology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. there
is no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) 'started off'
in perfect condition. it seems to adapt to its envionment, in a
collective sense. i'm really curious as to what you mean by 'the
degeneration of the genetic code'.
umm. nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and
bacteria, and they to us. only a very small percentage of microlife is
harmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby
constant in size, but the ranks keep changing. for example, bubonic
plague used to be a really nasty disease, i'm sure you'll agree. but
it still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn't do as
much damage. part of that is because of better sanitation, but even
when people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in
the past. this seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible
died off long ago, and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed',
(forgive the poor terminology, i'm an engineer, not a doctor! :- ) and
died off for lack of nearby hosts.
i could be wrong on this, but from what i gather acne is only a few
hundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer. it seems to
be getting less nasty w age...
now, wait a minute. i have a question. humans were created perfect, right?
and, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. it
seems unlikely that satan, who's making the diseases, would also gift
humans with the means to fight them off. simpler to make the diseases less
lethal, if he wants survivors. as far as i can see, our immune systems,
imperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us
by god. i want to be clear on this: are you saying that god was planning
ahead for the time when satan would be in charge by building an immune
system that was not, at the time of design, necessary? that is, god made
our immune systems ahead of time, knowing that adam and eve would sin and
their descendents would need to fight off diseases?
here's another puzzle. what, exactly, do you mean by 'perfect' in the
phrase, 'created... perfect and without flaw'? to my mind, a 'perfect'
system would be incapable of degrading over time. a 'perfect' system
that will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is not a
perfect system. at least, imho.
or is it that god did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a
bunch of gum wrappers held together with elmer's glue? that is, the
original genetic 'instructions' were perfect, but were 'written' in
inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart?
if so, why could god not have used better materials?
was god incapable of creating a system that could maintain itself,
of did it just choose not to? deletions my main point, as i said, was that there really isn't any evidence for
the explanation you give. (at least, that i'm aware of.) but, i couldn't

perhaps the biggest ""imperfection"" of the code is that it is full
of non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they
intervene with the coding regions (exons). an impressive amount of
evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is
likely that early exons represented early protein domains.
is the number of introns decreasing or increasing? it appears that
intron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually
have quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes.
on the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted
later, presents several logical difficulties. introns are removed
by a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused,
if introns are inserted. moreover, intron insertion would have
required precise targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated,
since sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mrna) are
conserved. besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a
trace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and
these are not found in or near intron sequences.
i seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and
genetics before posting ""theological arguments"" like this.
try watson's molecular biology of the gene or darnell, lodish baltimore's molecular biology of the cell for starters.
: remember, the question was posed in a theological context (why does
: god cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a
: theological perspective -- my own. it is no less valid than a purely
: scientific perspective, just different.
scientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas
theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.
: i think you misread my meaning. i said god made the genetic code perfect,
: but that doesn't mean it's perfect now. it has certainly evolved since.
for the worse? would you please cite a few references that support
your assertion? your assertion is less valid than the scientific
perspective, unless you support it by some evidence.
in fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps
more important than we've thought - for instance, sex might
have evolved as defence against parasites. (this view is supported by
computer simulations of evolution, eg tierra.)
: perhaps. i thought it was higher energy rays like x-rays, gamma
: rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.
in fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although
it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action.
: actually, neither of us ""knows"" what the atmosphere was like at the
: time when god created life. according to my recollection, most
: biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after
: all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth
: was created. it would still be too primitive to support life. i
: seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for
: the origination of life on earth. anyone with a better estimate?
i'd replace ""created"" with ""formed"", since there is no need to
invoke any creator if the earth can be formed without one.
most recent estimates of the age of the earth range between 4.6 - 4.8
billion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but
organic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years.
this would leave more than billion years for the first cells to
evolve.
i'm sorry i can't give any references, this is based on the course
on evolutionary biochemistry i attended here.
: dominion, it was no great feat for satan to genetically engineer
: diseases, both bacterial viral and genetic. although the forces of
: natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the
: degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.
again, do you want this be true, or do you have any evidence for
this supposed ""degeneration""?
i can understand scott's reaction:
: excuse me, but this is so far-fetched that i know you must be
: jesting. do you know what pathogens are? do you know what
: point mutations are? do you know that everything can come
: about spontaneously?!!!!!
:
: in response to your last statement, no, and neither do you.
: you may very well believe that and accept it as fact, but you
: cannot know that.
i hope you don't forget this: we have evidence that suggests
everything can come about spontaneously. do you have evidence against
this conclusion? in science, one does not have to believe in
anything. it is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. but the
right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so,
and not to present one's own conclusions prior to this.
theology does not use this method. therefore, i seriously doubt
it could ever come to right conclusions.
: human dna, being more ""complex"", tends to accumulate errors adversely
: affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the
: simpler dna of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in
: causing infection and disease. it is a bad combination. hence
: we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial
: diseases disorders.
you are supposing a purpose, not a valid move. bacteria and viruses
do not exist to cause disease. they are just another manifests of
a general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators
from degradiation. we are just an efficient method for our dna to
survive and replicate. the less efficient methods didn't make it
to the present.
and for the last time. please present some evidence for your claim that
human dna is degrading through evolutionary processes. some people have
claimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection,
and thus are bound to degrade. i haven't seen much evidence for either
claim.
: but then i ask, so? where is this relevant to my discussion in
: answering john's question of why? why are there genetic diseases,
: and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require
: babies to develop antibodies. is it god's fault? (the original
: question) -- i say no, it is not.
of course, nothing ""evil"" is god's fault. but your explanation does
not work, it fails miserably.
: you may be right. but the fact is that you don't know that
: satan is not responsible, and neither do i.
:
: suppose that a powerful, evil being like satan exists. would it
: be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills
: that affect mankind? i don't think so.
he could have done a much better job. (pun intended.) the problem is,
it seems no satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are
just as inevitable as any product of evolution.
: did i say that? where? seems to me like another bad inference.
: actually what you've done is to oversimplify what i said to the
: point that your summary of my words takes on a new context. i
: never said that people are ""meant"" (presumably by god) ""to be
: punished by getting diseases"". why i did say is that free moral
: choices have attendent consequences. if mankind chooses to reject
: god, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not
: expect god to protect them from adverse events in an entropic
: universe.
i am not expecting this. if god exists, i expect him to leave us alone.
i would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed
free. this is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer
is not as clear-cut as it seems to be.
what consequences would you expect from rejecting allah?
: oh, i admit it's not perfect (yet). but i'm working on it. :)
a good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.
: what does this have to do with the price of tea in china, or the
: question to which i provided an answer? biology and genetics are
: fine subjects and important scientific endeavors. but they explain
: how god created and set up life processes. they don't explain
: the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.
why is there a ""why behind""? and your proposition was something
that is not supported by the evidence. this is why we recommend
these books.
is there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? evidence
for this? if the whole universe can come into existence without
any intervention, as recent cosmological theories (hawking et al)
suggest, why do people still insist on this?
: thanks scotty, for your fine and sagely advice. but i am
: not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details
: of biology and genetics, although i'm sure i'd find it a
: fascinating subject. for i realize that the details do
: not change the big picture, that god created life in the
: beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its
: environment.
i'm sorry, but they do. there is no evidence for your big picture,
and no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation.
it can come into existence without a supreme being.

zen buddhist"
51231.eml,alt.atheism,"for many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an
epistemological consideration: what do we accept as a reliable way of
knowing? there are no known valid logical arguments for the existence
of gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist. most
philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that
must be accepted on faith. faith is belief without a sound logical
basis or empirical evidence. it is a reliable way of knowing?
there is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence
of any possibility of proof. even when we agree to take someone elses
word ""on faith"", we just mean that having found this person to be
reliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now.
if we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence
everywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about
gods?
the difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then
one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing,
rather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith
is in gods or no gods. the theist believes that faith is an acceptable
basis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at
other times, for example in his work as a scientist. the atheist
believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable
knowledge. agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than
theism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other
knowledge. without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather than
santa claus or the easter bunny?
i would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn't
require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods. i don't believe that
there is any such thing as absolute knowledge. atheism is the best and
simplest theory to fit the (lack of) facts and so should be held until
contrary evidence is found.

how the religious folk would act had they not been exposed to religion,

all atheists, in general, as well. i don't think that any of the quotes
(although i seem to have lost them) mentioned anything at all about jesus.
they advocated religion over non-religion. a specific religion was not
mentioned.
so, you are saying that all christians must believe that all other religions
should be outlawed, just because they think they are wrong? that's silly.
i think the flat-earthers are wrong, but i don't advocate their banishment.
i think that any such cost would be insignificant. i mentioned the slight
cost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by
being on our currency.
well, mottos in general don't really have purposes... i don't think it
should be removed because i think the benefit would be outweighed by the
consequences.
then you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress.
why not? it is the majority that put it there.
but do they remember the debate surrounding the motto? do they remember
that some people intended it to be a message against atheists? why don't
you include this in your little survey that you were conducting? ... what? should i ask some scientists the probability that something einstein
said about relativity is worthy? i mean, if einstein said it, there's a
good chance that it was right (at least at the time).

what strikes me as self-contradicting in the fable of lucifer's
fall - which, by the way, i seem to recall to be more speculation
than based on biblical text, but my ex rcism may be showing - is
that, as benedikt pointed out, lucifer had perfect nature, yet he
had the free will to ""choose"" evil. but where did that choice come
from?
we know from genesis that eve was offered an opportunity to sin by a
tempter which many assume was satan, but how did lucifer discover,
invent, create, call the action what you will, something that god
had not given origin to?
also, where in the bible is there mention of lucifer's free will?
we make a big fuss about mankind having free will, but it strikes me
as being an after-the-fact rationalisation, and in fact, like
salvation, not one that all christians believe in identically.
at least in my mind, salvation and free will are very tightly
coupled, but then my theology was roman catholic...
still, how do theologian explain lucifer's fall? if lucifer had
perfect nature (did man?) how could he fall? how could he execute an
act that (a) contradicted his nature and (b) in effect cause evil to
exist for the first time?

51247.eml,alt.atheism,"at the cost of repudiating the faq, i think too much is made of the
strong vs weak atheism issue, although in the context of alt.atheism,
where we're continually attacked on the basis that strong atheists
""believe"" in the non-existence of god, i think the separation is a
valid one.
to cover my arse, what i'm trying to say is that there is an
infinitely grey area between weak and strong, as well as between
strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism (i wish!). whereas i logically can only support the weak atheist position, in effect i am
a strong atheist (and wish i could be a mathematical one). to
justify my strong atheist position i believe i need only show that
the evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny
is faulty.
if i read the faq correctly, no argument for the existence of god
(generic, as represented by mainstream theologians) has ever been
found to be unassailable. to me this is adequate evidence that the real god is undefinable (or at least no definition has yet been
found to be watertight), which in turn i accept as sufficient to
base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god.
i'm a little fuzzy on the edges, though, so opinions are welcome

51254.eml,alt.atheism,"it seems to me that there is a contradiction in arguing that the bible
was ""enlightened for its times"" (i.e. closer to what we would consider
morally good based on our standards and past experience) on the one
hand i hope this summarizes this argument adequately , and on the
other hand: disclaimer: i'm speaking from the jewish perspective, where ""the bible"" means what many call the old testament, and where the interpretation is not necessarily the raw text, but instead the court cases, commentaries and traditions passed down through jewish communities. this seems the crux to me: if you judge the bible according to a long line of traditions and interpretations coming down to the current day, rather than on its own merits as a cultural artifact, then of course it will correspond more closely with more contemporary values. but if that's how the bible is actually being used today, shouldn't that be how we should judge it? if most people use scissors to cut paper, shouldn't consumer's reports test scissors for paper-cutting ability, even though scissors may have been designed originally to cut cloth?
that's possibly a good way to judge the use of the bible in teaching
jewish morality today, but it hardly seems fair to claim that this
highly-interpreted version is what was ""enlightened for its times"".
to (attempt to) extend the analogy, this is like saying that the
original scissor-makers were unusually advanced at paper-cutting for
their times, even though they only ever cut cloth, and had never even
heard of paper.
i'm not arguing that the bible is ""disgusting"", though some of the
history depicted in it is, by modern standards. however, history is
full of similar abuses, and i don't think the biblical accounts are
worse than their contemporaries--or possibly ours. on the other hand,
i don't know of any reason to think the history described in the bible
shows less abuse than their contemporaries, or ours. that complex
and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic
interpretations of that history is interesting, but i still don't
think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it
to attack condemnation of the original history.

conclude that when ""a exist"" is meaningless a does not exist. under the
pragmatic definition of truth, ""a exists"" is meaningless makes a exist
even logically false.
a problem with such statements is that one can't disprove a subjective god
by definition, and there might be cases where a subjective god would even
make sense. the trouble with most god definitions is that they include
some form of objective existence with the consequence of the gods affecting

we will grant that a god exists, and uses revelation to communicate
with humans. (said revelation taking the form (paraphrased from your

makes him take dictation, and then hides away for a few hundred years'.)
now, there exists a human who has not personally experienced a
revelation. this person observes that not only do these revelations seem
to contain elements that contradict rather strongly aspects of the
observed world (which is all this person has ever seen), but there are
many mutually contradictory claims of revelation.
now, based on this, can this person be blamed for concluding, absent
a personal revelation of their own, that there is almost certainly
nothing to this 'revelation' thing?
absent this better language, and absent observations in support of the
claims of revelation, can one be blamed for doubting the whole thing?

51278.eml,alt.atheism,"okay... i argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago. men and women are
different ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically. much
recent evidence for this statement is present in the book ""brainsex"" by
anne moir and david jessel. i recommend you find a copy and read it.
their book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic
and is well referenced.
now, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only
adequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are
different by also taking into account the ways in which men and women
are different. maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into
account that women get pregnant. it does not give women the same rules
it would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this
instance would be unjust. this is just simply an obvious example of
where men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!
now, people make the naive argument that sexism oppression.
however, maternity leave is sexist because men do not get pregnant.
men do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same
extent or degree), and therefore it is sexist. no matter however much a
man wants to get pregnant and have maternity leave, he never can. and
therefore the law is sexist. no man can have access to maternity leave,
no matter how hard he tries to get pregnant. i hope this is clear.
maternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the
sexism here just reflects the ""sexism"" of nature in making men and women
different. there are many other differences between men and women which
are far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these i
recommend you have a look at the book ""brainsex"".
your point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.
if men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically
become women! to have a womb and the other factors required for
pregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --
so your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious. you
are saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that
women can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports
my statement that maternity leave is sexist.
there is no official priesthood in islam -- much of this function is
taken by islamic scholars. there are female islamic scholars and
female islamic scholars have always existed in islam. an example from
early islamic history is the prophet's widow, aisha, who was recognized
in her time and is recognized in our time as an islamic scholar.
you have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and
i dispute it. i could go on and on about women in islam, etc., but i
recently reposted something here under the heading ""islam and women"" --
if it is still at your news-site i suggest you read it. it is reposted
from soc.religion.islam, so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism it
still might be in soc.religion.islam (i forgot what its original title
was though). i will email it to you if you like.
your statement that ""other religions are no different"" is, i think, a
statement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than
christianity and perhaps judaism.
aisha, who i mentioned earlier, was not only an islamic scholar but also
was, at one stage, a military leader.

have sex. before the go to sleep at night, they have sex. after they
escape from or fight off prdators, they have sex. sex serves a very important
social function above and beyond reproduction in this species. a species
closely related to humans. there is some indication that sex performs
a social function in humans, as well, but even if not, this shows that
such a function is not impossible .

back in the 1960s. the issue wasn't gays, but the principles were the
same. thanks for a well put testimonial. stan krieger and his kind who
think this discussion doesn't belong here and his intolerance is the
only acceptable position in scouting should take notice. the bsa has
been hijacked by the religious right, but some of the core values have
survived in spite of the leadership and some scouts and former scouts
haven't given up. seeing a testimonial like this reminds me that
scouting is still worth fighting for.
on a cautionary note, you must realize that if your experience with this

51290.eml,alt.atheism,"isn't that what i said ...
what are you taking issue with here, your remarks are merely
parenthetical to mine and add nothing useful.
: ... :
: it would seem odd if homosexuality had any evolutionary function
: (other than limiting population growth) since evolution only occurs
: when the members of one generation pass along their traits to
: subsequent generations. homosexuality is an evolutionary deadend. if i
: take your usage of the term, homophobe, in the sense you seem to
: intend, then all men are really homosexual and evolution of our
: species at least, is going nowhere.
: :
: so every time a man has sex with a woman they intend to produce children?
: hmm...no wonder the world is overpopulated. obviously you keep to the
: monty python song: ""every sperm is sacred"". and if, as you say, it has
: a purpose as a means to limit population growth then it is, by your own
: arguement, natural.
consider the context, i'm talking about an evolutionary function. one
of the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of a
species procreate, those who don't have no purpose in that context.
:
: another point is that if the offspring of each generation is to
: survive, the participation of both parents is necessary - a family must
: exist, since homosexuals do not reproduce, they cannot constitute a
: family. since the majority of humankind is part of a family,
: homosexuality is an evolutionary abberation, contrary to nature if you
: will.
: :
: well if that is true, by your own arguements homosexuals would have
: vanished years ago due to non-procreation. also the parent from single
: parent families should put the babies out in the cold now, cos they must,
: by your arguement, die.
by your argument, homosexuality is genetically determined. as to your
second point, you prove again that you have no idea what context
means. i am talking about evolution, the preservation of the species,
the fundamental premise of the whole process.
:
: but it gets worse. since the overwhelming majority of people actually
: -prefer- a heterosexual relationship, homosexuality is a social
: abberation as well. the homosexual eschews the biological imperative
: to reproduce and then the social imperative to form and participate in
: the most fundamental social element, the family. but wait, there's
: more.
: :
: read the above. i expect you to have at least ten children by now, with
: the family growing. these days sex is less to do with procreation (admittedly
: without it there would be no-one) but more to do with pleasure. in pre-pill
: and pre-condom days, if you had sex there was the chance of producing children.
: these days is just ain't true! people can decide whether or not to have
: children and when. soon they will be able to choose it's sex c (but that's
: another arguement...) so it's more of a ""lifestyle"" decision. again by
: your arguement, since homosexuals can not (or choose not) to reproduce they must
: be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children. both are
: as ""unnatural"" as each other.
yet another non-sequitur. sex is an evolutionary function that exists
for procreation, that it is also recreation is incidental. that
homosexuals don't procreate means that sex is -only- recreation and
nothing more; they serve no -evolutionary- purpose.
:
: since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some
: policy makers that they have civil rights, they are now claiming that
: their sexuality is a preference, a life-style, an orientation, a
: choice that should be protected by law. now if homosexuality is a mere
: choice and if it is both contrary to nature and anti-social, then it
: is a perverse choice; they have even less credibility than before they
: became prominent.
: :
: people are people are people. who are you to tell anyone else how to live
: their life? are you god(tm)? if so, fancy a date?
here's pretty obvious dodge, do you really think you've said anything
or do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement? i am not
telling anyone anything, i am demonstrating that there are arguments
against the practice of homosexuality (providing it's a merely an
alternate lifestlye) that are not homophobic, that one can reasonably
call it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand. i realize
of course that this comes dangerously close to establishing a value,
and that atheists are compelled to object on that basis, but if you
are to be consistent, you have no case in this regard.
:
: to characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic is to
: ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization of
: the homosexual ""life-style"". but since the charge is only intended to
: intimidate, it's really just demogoguery and not to be taken
: seriously. fact is, jim, there are far more persuasive arguments for
: suppressing homosexuality than those given, but consider this a start.
: :
: again crap. all your arguments are based on outdated ideals. likewise the
: bible. would any honest christian condemn the ten generations spawned by
: a ""bastard"" to eternal damnation? or someone who crushes his penis (either
: accidently or not..!). both are in deuteronomy.
i'm sure your comment pertains to something, but you've disguised it
so well i can't see what. where did i mention ideals, out-dated or
otherwise? your arguments are very reactionary; do you have anything
at all to contribute?
:
: as to why homosexuals should be excluded from participation in
: scouting, the reasons are the same as those used to restrict them from
: teaching; by their own logic, homosexuals are deviates, social and
: biological. since any adult is a role model for a child, it is
: incumbent on the parent to ensure that the child be isolated from
: those who would do the child harm. in this case, harm means primarily
: social, though that could be extended easily enough.
: : :
: you show me anyone who has sex in a way that everyone would describe as
: normal, and will take of my hat (puma baseball cap) to you. ""one man's meat

you miss the point entirely. things defined by contradictory language

drawn from the description are wrong, unless there is the possibility
to find the described, and draw conclusions from direct knowledge of
the described then. another possibility is to drop the contradictory
part, but that implies that one can trust the concept as presented

don't hold back; he's considered an apostate and a blasphemer.
however, it's not for his writing in the satanic verses , but for
what people have accepted as a propagandistic version of what is
contained in that book. i have yet to find one single muslim who
has convinced me that they have read the book. some have initially
claimed to have done so, but none has shown more knowledge of the book
than a superficial newsweek story might impart, and all have made
factual misstatements about events in the book.

51301.eml,alt.atheism,"from what i read, the other fellow told salameh how to put it together
over the phone. the bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated
type, so to put a (i assume complicated) sophisticated bomb together
from instructions over the phone (!) one must need some brains i would
expect.
i read this in an article in ""the australian muslim times"", the
newspaper (weekly) of the australian muslim community.
if this is true, perhaps one of the muslims based in north america (if
they see this posting) can elaborate.
i don't deny this fact.
the thrust of my argument here is that
(a) salameh is, according to us law, innocent as he has not been found
guilty in a court of law. as his guilt has not been established, it is
wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.
(b) islam teaches us not to harm innocents. if muslims -- who perhaps
have not realized that islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is not because of the teachings of islam, but rather in spite of and in contradiction to the teachings of islam. this is an important
distinction.
i should clarify what muslims usually mean when they say ""muslim"". in
general, anyone who calls themselves a ""muslim"" and does not do or
outwardly profess
something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of islam
is considered to be a muslim. thus, one who might do things contrary to
islam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly not become a
muslim. if one knowingly transgresses islamic teachings and essential
principles, though, then one does leave islam.
the term ""muslim"" is to be contrasted with ""mu'min"", which means ""true
believer"". however, whether a muslim is in reality a mu'min is
something known only by god (and perhaps that person himself). so you
will not find the term mu'min used very much by muslims in alt.atheism,
because it is not known to anybody (except myself and god), whether i,
for example, am a ""true believer"" or not. for example, i could just be
putting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to
what i write here, without anyone knowing. thus, when we say ""muslims""
we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow islam, whether in
practice they might, in ignorance, transgress islamic teachings. by
""muslim"" we do not necessarily mean ""mu'min"", or ""true believer"" in
islam.

say the car drives because i've seen it drive - i've done more
than at in fact - i've actually driven it. (now what does require
some faith is the belief that my senses give an accurate representation
of what's out there....) but there is no evidence - pro or con -
for the existence or non-existence of god (see what i have to
say below on this).
sorry if i remain skeptical - i don't believe it's entirely a
conclusion. that you have seen no evidence that there is a god
is correct - neither have i. but lack of evidence for the existence
of something is in no way evidence for the non-existence of something
(the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they
disprove evolution the establish creation). you (personally) have never
seen a neutrino before, but they exist. the ""pink unicorn"" analogy breaks
down and is rather naive. i have a scientific theory that explains the
appearance of animal life - evolution. when i draw the conclusion that
""pink unicorns"" don't exist because i haven't seen them, this conclusion
has it's foundation in observation and theory. a ""pink unicorn"", if
it did exist, would be qualitatively similar to other known entities.
that is to say, since there is good evidence that all life on earth has
evolved from ""more primitive"" ancestors these pink unicorns would share
a common anscestory with horses and zebras and such. god, however,
has no such correspondence with anything (imo). there is no physical
frame work of observation to draw any conclusions from.
i disagree with you profoundly on this. i haven't defined god as
existence - in fact, i haven't defined god. but this might be
getting off the subject - although if you think it's relevant
we can come back to it.
you are using wrong categories here - or perhaps you misunderstand
what i'm saying. i'm making no argument what so ever and offering no
definition so there is no fallacy. i'm not trying to convince you of
anything. i believe - and that rests upon faith. and it is inappropriate
to apply the category of logic in this realm (unless someone tells you
that they can logically prove god or that they have ""evidence"" or ...,
then the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary).
btw, an incomplete argument is not a fallacy - some things are not
even wrong.
i don't follow you here. certainly one can make observations of
things that they didn't know existed. i still maintain that one
cannot use observation to infer that ""god does not exist"". such
a positive assertion requires a leap.
once again you seem to completely misunderstand me. i have no
evidence that ""'god is' is meaningful"" at any level. maybe such
a response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so
many people try to run their own private conception of god down
your throat. i, however, am not doing this. i am arguing one, and
only one, thing - that to make a positive assertion about something
for which there can in principle be no evidence for or against
requires a leap - it requires faith. i am, as you would say, a
""theist""; however, there is a form of atheism that i can respect -
but it must be founded upon honesty.

jim,
there are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread
that are a little confusing. an atheist is one for whom all things can
be understood as processes of nature - exclusively. there is no need
for any recourse to divnity to describe or explain anything. there is
no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by
physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is
determnined.
this would also have to include human intelligence of course and all
its products. there is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it
acquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident. for an atheist, no
event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less
value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-
an event can have value.
the products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,
from teaching, training, observation and experience and are only
significant to the individual mind wherein they reside. these mental
processes and the images they produce for us are just electrical
activity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. the human
mind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a
hill.
how then can an atheist judge value? what is the basis for criticizing
the values ennumerated in the bible or the purposes imputed to god? on
what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? it
seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you
have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what
in nature can serve that purpose? what law of nature can you invoke to
establish your values.
since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what
difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or
otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. the only
way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the
objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it
- that's it. any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer
that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries
no weight in any ""absolute"" sense.
that you don't like what god told people to do says nothing about god
or god's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your
nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled
with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. that your
objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been
conditioned; there is no ""truth"" content. the whole of your
intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.
i didn't make these rules, it's inherent in naturalistic atheism and
to be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human
thought, even your own. all of this being so, you have excluded
yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,
etc. and cannot participate. your opinion about the bible can have no
weight whatsoever.

one must approach the qur'an with intelligence. any thinking approach
to the qur'an cannot but interpret the above verse and others like it
that women and men are spiritual equals.
i think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have
souls. does it make any sense for something without a soul to be
forgiven? or to have a great reward (understood to be in the
after-life)? i think the usual answer would be no -- in which case, the

says they have souls.

i have no idea what a soul is.)
as for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority
in all interpretations, any thinking approach to the qur'an has to give
all verses of the qur'an equal priority. that is because, according to
muslim belief, the whole qur'an is the revelation of god -- in fact,
denying the truth of any part of the qur'an is sufficient to be
considered a disbeliever in islam.
look, any approach to the qur'an must be done with intelligence and
thought. it is in this fashion that one can try to understand the
quran's message. in a book of finite length, it cannot explicitly
answer every question you want to put to it, but through its teachings
it can guide you. i think, however, that women are the spiritual equals
of men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse, and that
since women can clearly be ""forgiven"" and ""rewarded"" they must have
souls (from the above verse).
let's try to understand what the qur'an is trying to teach, rather than
try to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this
passage or that passage. the misinterpretations of the qur'an based on
ignoring this verse or that verse are infinite, but the interpretations
fully consistent are more limited. let's try to discuss these
interpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can
ignore this bit or that bit, for that is just showing how people can try
to twist islam for their own ends -- something i do not deny -- but
provides no reflection on the true teachings of islam whatsoever.

51319.eml,alt.atheism,"you misrepresent me, selim. the hard evidence for my statements about
his lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book
""orientalism"" by edward said. edward said, by the way, is a christian,
not a muslim.
regarding bernard lewis:
him being a zionist gives him a political motive for his
giving misrepresentations and half-truths about islam.
read ""orientalism"" by edward said -- see the evidence for yourself.
in fact, i may post some of it here (if it isn't too long).
i haven't read lewis's article, so i can't comment directly upon it, and
have only spoken about his writings in general so far, that his
political motives make him a biased writer on islam. his anti-islamic
polemics, as i understand it, are often quite subtle and are often based
on telling half-truths.
again, read ""orientalism"" by edward said. i am not asking you to take
what i say on trust, in fact i am urging you not to do so but to get
this book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for yourself .
if slavery is in reality (as opposed to in the practice of some
muslims) opposed by islam, then using slaves for sexual
purposes is necessarily opposed too.
i understand your point of view, selim -- i think, rather, it is us who are not getting through to you .
some of the points you repeat above i have already answered before.
regarding women, i have made posting after posting on this subject,
showing that islam is not anti-woman, etc. however, have you been
completely ignoring my postings or just missing them? i just reposted a
very good one, under the title ""islam and women"", reposted from
soc.religion.islam. if this has already disappeared from your site,
then please email me telling me so and i will email you a copy of this
excellent article.
imho, your understanding of the issue of women in islam is sadly deficient.
regarding slaves, my posting on slavery -- the second one i made,
which is a repost of an article i wrote early last year -- is based
completely on the qur'an and contains numerous qur'anic verses and
hadiths to support its point of view.
our approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical
standpoint and i am arguing directly from the teachings of the qur'an
and hadiths. now, just because people say they are muslims and perform
a particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is
part of islam, even if it is opposed by the qur'an and sunnah? no! of
course not.
let me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for
you. the qur'an prohibits drinking. now, if a person says ""i am a
muslim"" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean
that islam teaches that people should drink beer? of course not, and
only an idiot would think so.
do you see my point?
you are judging islam here on capitalist terms. capitalism is an
ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise
their wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to islamic teachings.
to say islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --
islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be
capitalist. (this does not mean that islam does not support a
free-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of
capitalism which are opposed to islam as i understand it.)
one can postulate numerous reasons for this. your theory is that it is
because islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.
selim, i will give you a clear historical example to show you the
fallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that
islam lack of education and power.
for a large part of history, the islamic world was very powerful. for a
significant section of history, the islamic world was the foremost in
the sciences. so to say that islam is, for example, anti-education is
completely absurd. you try to blame this situation on islam -- history
shows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be
other reasons for this situation.
well, selim, your viewpoint on women in islam makes me question the extent
of your knowledge of islam. i really think you are not
knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the muslims are
following the qur'an or not.
the islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one
stage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by ""following the qur'an""
that muslims are backwards in education. selim, it is your thesis
that is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical
fact which contradicts your theory.
you have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.
so far, it seems to me that your view on islam being anti-education is
quite contrary to history. that you are so convinced of your views
makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of
this.
i think, selim, you should consider taking your own advice.
here too.
selim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate
ignorance, not only of islam but also of islamic history (particularly
with respect to muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so i
think). yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!
selim, if i remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that
you are an apostate from islam. i think you should slow down and start
thinking clearly about the issues, and start reading some of our
postings about islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously
have.

51320.eml,alt.atheism,"i think the problem here is that i pretty much ignored the part
about the jews sightseeing for 2000 years, thinking instead that
the important part of what the original poster said was the bit
about killing palestinians. in retrospect, i can see how the
sightseeing thing would be offensive to many. i originally saw
it just as poetic license, but it's understandable that others
might see it differently. i still think that ken came on a bit
strong though. i also think that your advice to masud khan: before you argue with someone like mr arromdee, it's a good idea to do a little homework, or at least think.
was unnecessary.
throughout all your articles in this thread there is the tacit
assumption that the original poster was exhibiting casual
anti-semitism. if i agreed with that, then maybe your speech
on why this is bad might have been relevant. but i think you're
reading a lot into one flip sentence. while probably not
true in this case, too often the charge of anti-semitism gets
thrown around in order to stifle legitimate criticism of the

subject: what is the purpose of this newsgroup?
typical posting:
why have a newsgroup about atheism? why do atheists organize in groups?
what is there to discuss?
response:
many things are discussed here, including: whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's
family prayer in schools discrimination against atheists sunday trading laws the satanic child abuse myth whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet' how religious societies prey (sic) on new college students how to get rid of unwanted proselytizers whether religion is a danger to society and or the individual why people become atheists
of course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical christians
looking for someone to convert. most readers of the newsgroup don't
want to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure
from tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.
subject: hitler was an atheist!
typical posting:
hitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!
response:
adolf hitler was emphatically not an atheist. as he said himself:
the folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in
his own denomination, of making people stop just talking superficially of god's will, and actually fulfill god's will, and not let god's word be desecrated. orig. ital. for god's will gave men their form, their essence, and their
abilities. anyone who destroys his work is declaring war on the
lord's creation, the divine will. therefore, let every man be
active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every
man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who
in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his
religious community and tries to butt into the other. ... hence today i believe that i am acting in accordance with the will
of the almighty creator: by defending myself against the jew, i am fighting for the work of the lord. orig. ital. of course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief
wrong. it's also entirely possible that hitler was lying when he claimed
to believe in god. we certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist,
though.
subject: the bible proves it
typical posting:
in the bible it says that...
response:
most of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the bible is of questionable
accuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were
recording oral tradition that existed many years before. thus, any claimed
'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy. this isn't to say that the
bible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being
accepted.
many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is
subject to ""interpretation"", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and
one thing only is not legitimate.
note that this feeling tends to extend to other books.
it is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other
equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.
subject: pascal's wager
typical posting:
if you believe in god and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --
but if you don't believe in god and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to
hell. therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.
response:
this argument is known as pascal's wager. it has several flaws.
firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow. indeed, there are
many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there. this is often
described as the ""avoiding the wrong hell"" problem. if a person is a
follower of religion x, he may end up in religion y's version of hell.
secondly, the statement that ""if you believe in god and turn out to be
incorrect, you have lost nothing"" is not true. suppose you're believing in
the wrong god -- the true god might punish you for your foolishness.
consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in
favour of prayer.
another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that
the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of
comparable likelihood. if, in fact, the possibility of there being a god
is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive. so sadly the
argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.
also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on
evidence, with some amount of intuition. it is not a matter of will or
cost-benefit analysis.
formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:
1. one does not know whether god exists.
2. not believing in god is bad for one's eternal soul if god does
exist.
3. believing in god is of no consequence if god does not exist.
4. therefore it is in one's interest to believe in god.
there are two approaches to the argument. the first is to view 1 as an
assumption, and 2 as a consequence of it. one problem with this approach, in
the abstract, is that it creates information from no information. this is
considered invalid in information theory. statement 1 indicates one has no
information about god -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information
can be gained from the absolute lack of information about god. this violates
information entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at
no ""cost"".
the alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions. the
problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the
christian position, and only a christian will agree with that assumption. the
argument thus collapses to ""if you are a christian, it is in your interests
to believe in god"" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way pascal
intended the argument to be viewed.
the biggest reason why pascal's wager is a failure is that if god is
omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as
a wager. he will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all
whether people believe in him.
subject: what is occam's razor?
typical posting:
people keep talking about occam's razor. what is it?
response:
william of occam formulated a principle which has become known as occam's
razor. in its original form, it said ""do not multiply entities
unnecessarily."" that is, if you can explain something without supposing
the existence of some entity, then do so.
nowadays when people refer to occam's razor, they generally express it
more generally, for example as ""take the simplest solution"".
the relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations
for what we see around us:
1. there is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which
came into being as a result of natural processes.
2. there is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and
there is also a god who created the universe. clearly this god must be
of non-zero complexity.
given that both explanations fit the facts, occam's razor might suggest
that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.
unfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:
3. there isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.
we just imagine that there is.
this third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people
find unacceptable.
subject: why it's good to believe in jesus
typical posting:
i want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.
response:
preaching is not appreciated.
feel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that
are on a ""conversion"" theme. such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and
will be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup
talk.religion.misc).
you would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite
newsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would
have them do unto you!
often theists make their basic claims about god in the form of lengthy
analogies or parables. be aware that atheists have heard of god and know the
basic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell
atheists that god exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,
since it tells us nothing we have not been told before.
subject: why i know that god exists
typical posting:
i know from personal experience and prayer that god exists.
response:
just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship
exists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not
exist. that evidence varies from person to person.
furthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many
people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been
abducted by ufos, visited by the ghost of elvis, and so on.
subject: einstein and ""god does not play dice""
typical posting:
albert einstein believed in god. do you think you're cleverer than him?
response:
einstein did once comment that ""god does not play dice with the universe "".
this quotation is commonly mentioned to show that einstein believed in the
christian god. used this way, it is out of context; it refers to einstein's
refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. furthermore,
einstein's religious background was jewish rather than christian.
a better quotation showing what einstein thought about god is the following:
""i believe in spinoza's god who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of
what exists, not in a god who concerns himself with fates and actions of
human beings.""
einstein was unable to accept quantum theory because of his belief in an
objective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random
events and which would not be dependent upon the observer. he believed that
qm was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for
statistical interpretations. so far no such better theory has been found,
and much evidence suggests that it never will be.
a longer quote from einstein appears in ""science, philosophy, and religion, a
symposium"", published by the conference on science, philosophy and religion
in their relation to the democratic way of life, inc., new york, 1941. in
it he says:
""the more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events
the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side
of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature. for him
neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an
independent cause of natural events. to be sure, the doctrine of a
personal god interfering with natural events could never be refuted italics his , in the real sense, by science, for this
doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific
knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.
but i am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives
of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal. for a doctrine
which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,
will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm
to human progress. in their struggle for the ethical good, teachers
of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal
god, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past
placed such vast power in the hands of priests. in their labors they
will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable
of cultivating the good, the true, and the beautiful in humanity
itself. this is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably
more worthy task...""
einstein has also said:
""it was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,
a lie which is being systematically repeated. i do not believe in a
personal god and i have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.
if something is in me which can be called religious then it is the
unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our
science can reveal it.""
the latter quote is from ""albert einstein: the human side"", edited by helen
dukas and banesh hoffman, and published by princeton university press.
also from the same book:
""i do not believe in immortality of the individual, and i consider ethics
to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind
it.""
of course, the fact that einstein chose not to believe in christianity does
not in itself imply that christianity is false.
subject: everyone worships something
typical posting:
everyone worships something, whether it's money, power or god.
response:
if that is true, everyone is a polytheist. theists care just as much about
those things that atheists care about. if the atheists' reactions to (for
example) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.
subject: why there must be a causeless cause
typical posting:
sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so
chains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.
response:
the set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has
no smallest member.
further, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does
not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and
especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by
any particular religion.
subject: the universe is so complex it must have been designed
typical posting:
the presence of design in the universe proves there is a god. surely you
don't think all this appeared here just by chance?
response:
this is known as the argument from design.
it is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the
universe. those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living
creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the
newsgroup talk.origins for a while.
there is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.
however, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of
so-called scientific creationism. furthermore, there is much evidence,
observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the
universe and life on earth.
the origin of the argument by design is a feeling that the existence of
something as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that
surely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some
external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos
deliberately.
but if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind
capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must
be immeasurably more unlikely? the approach used to argue in favour of the
existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the creationist
position.
this leads us to the familiar theme of ""if a creator created the universe,
what created the creator?"", but with the addition of spiralling
improbability. the only way out is to declare that the creator was not
created and just ""is"" (or ""was"").
from here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe
just ""is"" without introducing a creator? indeed stephen hawking, in his book
""a brief history of time"", explains his theory that the universe is closed
and finite in extent, with no beginning or end.
the argument from design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called
watchmaker argument. one is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on
the beach. does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it
evolved naturally? of course one assumes a watchmaker. yet like the
watch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the
universe too must have a creator.
the watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above
those common to all arguments by design. firstly, a watchmaker creates
watches from pre-existing materials, whereas god is claimed to have
created the universe from nothing. these two sorts of creation are
clearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.
secondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in
the world. if we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear
reactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker. the argument
would therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a
different part of creation.
finally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that
the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore
stands out from the randomness of nature. yet in the second part of the
argument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not
random, but shows elements of order. the watchmaker argument is thus
internally inconsistent.
subject: independent evidence that the bible is true
typical posting:
the events of the new testament are confirmed by independent documentary
evidence. for example...
response:
the writings of josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary
evidence.
early versions of josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned jesus or
james; the extant version discusses john in a non-christian context. many
scholars believe that the original mentioned jesus and james in passing, but
that this was expanded by christian copyists. several ""reconstructions"" of
the original text have been published to this effect.
much information appears in the ecclesiastical history of eusebius (about 320
c.e.). it is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate
falsification of the wily eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the
first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' it is eusebius who is
generally given the title of authorship for this material.
aside from the new testament, the biographical information about jesus is
more well-documented. for further information, please consult the frequently
asked questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.
subject: godel's incompleteness theorem
typical posting:
godel's incompleteness theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the
bible to be both true and complete.
response:
godel's first incompleteness theorem says that in any consistent formal
system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary
arithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be
valid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system. (technically
speaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision
procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal
system.)
essentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a ""liar
paradox."" the classic liar paradox sentence in ordinary english is ""this
sentence is false."" note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal
system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.
the logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims
that godel's incompleteness theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to
prove or disprove) the existence of god are worthless in isolation.
one can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the
existence of god, simply by having the existence of god stated as an axiom.
this is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.
it may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms
that both atheists and theists agree with. it may then be possible to show
that godel's incompleteness theorem holds for that system. however, that
would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that god exists
within the system. furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about
whether it is possible to prove the existence of god generally.
note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about
the actual existence of god; the formal systems are just abstractions.
another frequent claim is that godel's incompleteness theorem demonstrates
that a religious text (the bible, the book of mormon or whatever) cannot be
both consistent and universally applicable. religious texts are not formal
systems, so such claims are nonsense.
subject: george bush on atheism and patriotism
typical posting:
did george bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?
response:
the following exchange took place at the chicago airport between robert i.
sherman of american atheist press and george bush, on august 27 1988. sherman
is a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of
the press corps. the republican presidential nominee was there to announce
federal disaster relief for illinois. the discussion turned to the
presidential primary:
rs: ""what will you do to win the votes of americans who are atheists?""
gb: ""i guess i'm pretty weak in the atheist community. faith in
god is important to me.""
rs: ""surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of
americans who are atheists?""
gb: ""no, i don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,
nor should they be considered patriots. this is one nation under
god.""
rs: ""do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation
of state and church?""
gb: ""yes, i support the separation of church and state. i'm just not
very high on atheists.""
upi reported on may 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were
still angry over the remarks.
the exchange appeared in the boulder daily camera on monday february 27,
1989. it can also be found in ""free enquiry"" magazine, fall 1988 issue,
volume 8, number 4, page 16.
on october 29, 1988, mr. sherman had a confrontation with ed murnane,
cochairman of the bush-quayle '88 illinois campaign. this concerned a
lawsuit mr. sherman had filed to stop the community consolidated school
district 21 (chicago, illinois) from forcing his first-grade atheist son to
pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states as ""one nation under god""
(bush's phrase). the following conversation took place:
rs: ""american atheists filed the pledge of allegiance lawsuit yesterday.
does the bush campaign have an official response to this filing?""
em: ""it's bullshit.""
rs: ""what is bullshit?""
em: ""everything that american atheists does, rob, is bullshit.""
rs: ""thank you for telling me what the official position of the bush
campaign is on this issue.""
em: ""you're welcome.""
after bush's election, american atheists wrote to bush asking him to retract
his statement. on february 21st 1989, c. boyden gray, counsel to the
president, replied on white house stationery that bush substantively stood by
""as you are aware, the president is a religious man who neither supports
atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or
supported by the government.""

subject: i know where hell is!
typical posting:
i know where hell is! hell is in norway!
response:
there are several towns called ""hell"" in various countries around the
world, including norway and the usa. whilst this information is mildly
amusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now
getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.
subject: biblical contradictions wanted
typical posting:

subject: the usa is a christian nation
typical posting:
because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn't the
united states be considered a christian nation?
response:
based upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear
that they never intended the us to be a christian nation. here are some
quotes; there are many more.

subject: the usa is not a christian nation
typical posting:
is it true that george washington said that the united states is not in any
sense founded upon the christian religion?
response:
no. the quotation often given is in fact from article xi of the 1797 treaty
of tripoli (8 stat 154, treaty series 358):
article 11
as the government of the united states of america is not in any sense
founded on the christian religion, -- as it has in itself no character of
enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of musselmen, -- and as
the said states never have entered into any war or act of hostility
against any mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no
pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption
of the harmony existing between the two countries.
the text may be found in the congressional record or in treaty collections
such as charles bevans' ""treaties and other international agreements of the
united states of america 1776-1949"", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).
the english text of the treaty of tripoli was approved by the u.s. senate on
june 7, 1797 and ratified by president john adams on june 10, 1797. it was
recently discovered that the arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the
quotation, it lacks article xi altogether.
the person who translated the arabic to english was joel barlow, consul
general at algiers, a close friend of thomas paine -- and an opponent of
christianity. it is possible that barlow made up article xi, but since there
is no arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.
in 1806 a new treaty of tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the
quotation.

52909.eml,alt.atheism,"constructing a logical argument
although there is much argument on usenet, the general quality of argument
found is poor. this article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to
logic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.
logic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference concise
oed . logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether
it is correct or not (valid or invalid). of course, one does not need to
study logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic
knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an
argument.
note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally
applicable. the matter is very much open for debate. this document merely
explains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is
the right tool for the job.
propositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. a
proposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, ""it is
raining"" or ""today is tuesday"". propositions may be either asserted (said to
be true) or denied (said to be false). note that this is a technical meaning
of ""deny"", not the everyday meaning.
the proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular
arrangement of words used to express it. so ""god exists"" and ""there exists a
god"" both express the same proposition.
an argument is, to quote the monty python sketch, ""a connected series of
statements to establish a definite proposition"". an argument consists of
three stages.
first of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to
continue are stated. these are called the premises of the argument. they
are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions.
premises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as ""because"",
""since"", ""obviously"" and so on. (the phrase ""obviously"" is often viewed with
suspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious
premises. if something doesn't seem obvious to you, don't be afraid to
question it. you can always say ""oh, yes, you're right, it is obvious"" when
you've heard the explanation.)
next, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known
as inference. in inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of
one or more other propositions already accepted. there are various forms of
valid inference.
the propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further
inference. inference is often denoted by phrases such as ""implies that"" or
""therefore"".
finally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which
is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference. conclusions are often
indicated by phrases such as ""therefore"", ""it follows that"", ""we conclude""
and so on. the conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.
for example:
every event has a cause (premise)
the universe has a beginning (premise)
all beginnings involve an event (premise)
this implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)
therefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)
note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another
argument. a proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with
respect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.
sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,
the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated
afterwards in support of the conclusion. this is perfectly valid, if
sometimes a little confusing.
recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or
conclusions. many people shower their writing with assertions without ever
producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument. some
statements look like arguments, but are not. for example:
""if the bible is accurate, jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,
or the son of god.""
this is not an argument, it is a conditional statement. it does not assert
the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its
conclusion. (it also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we'll
come to those later.)
another example:
""god created you; therefore do your duty to god.""
the phrase ""do your duty to god"" is not a proposition, since it is neither
true nor false. therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an
argument.
finally, causality is important. consider a statement of the form ""a because
b"". if we're interested in establishing a and b is offered as evidence, the
statement is an argument. if we're trying to establish the truth of b, then
it is not an argument, it is an explanation.
for example:
""there must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not
start."" -- this is an argument.
""my car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.""
there are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive. a
deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions
also be true. a deductive argument is either valid or invalid. a valid
argument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the
conclusion is true.
an inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the
truth of the conclusion. inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;
however, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other
arguments, and about how probable their premises are.
there are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive
nor inductive. however, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive
arguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.
it is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does
not imply that its conclusion holds. this is because of the slightly
counter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more
carefully.
obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions. however, an
argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions.
for example:
all insects have wings (premise)
woodlice are insects (premise)
therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)
here, the conclusion is not true because the argument's premises are false.
if the argument's premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true.
the argument is thus entirely valid.
more subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,
as in:
all fish live in the sea (premise)
dolphins are fish (premise)
therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)
however, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid
inference from true premises. we can therefore draw up a ""truth table"" for
implication.
the symbol "" "" denotes implication; ""a"" is the premise, ""b"" the conclusion.
""t"" and ""f"" represent true and false respectively.
premise conclusion inference
a b a b
f f t if the premises are false and the inference
f t t valid, the conclusion can be true or false.
t f f if the premises are true and the conclusion
false, the inference must be invalid.
t t t if the premises are true and the inference valid,
the conclusion must be true.
a sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true. a sound
argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion. be careful not to confuse
valid arguments with sound arguments.
to delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require
lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy. it is simpler and probably
more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing
an argument. these pitfalls are known as fallacies.
in everyday english the term ""fallacy"" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs
as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs. this is fair
enough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of
technically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or
convincing.
so for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical
argument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect
when examined more closely. by studying fallacies we aim to avoid being
misled by them. the following list of fallacies is not intended to be
exhaustive.
argumentum ad baculum (appeal to force)
the appeal to force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the
threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion. it
is often used by politicians, and can be summarized as ""might makes right"".
the force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.
for example:
""... thus there is ample proof of the truth of the bible. all those who
refuse to accept that truth will burn in hell.""
argumentum ad hominem
argumentum ad hominem is literally ""argument directed at the man"".
the abusive variety of argumentum ad hominem occurs when, instead of trying
to disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or
people making the assertion. this is invalid because the truth of an
assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.
for example:
""atheism is an evil philosophy. it is practised by communists and murderers.""
sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by
showing, for example, that he is a known perjurer. this is a valid way of
reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not
argumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness's
testimony is false. to conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the
argumentum ad ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).
the circumstantial form of argumentum ad hominem is committed when a person
argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of
the opponent's particular circumstances.
for example:
""it is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food. how can you argue
otherwise when you're quite happy to wear leather shoes?""
this is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing
the opponent's argument.
this fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion. for
example:
""of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing.
you're white.""
this particular form of argumentum ad hominem, when one alleges that one's
adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is
also known as ""poisoning the well"".
argumentum ad ignorantium
argumentum ad ignorantium means ""argument from ignorance"". this fallacy
occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it
has not been proved false. or, equivalently, when it is argued that
something must be false because it has not been proved true. (note that this
is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved
true, a basic scientific principle.)
examples:
""of course the bible is true. nobody can prove otherwise.""
""of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist. nobody has
shown any proof that they are real.""
note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is
generally assumed innocent until proven guilty.
also, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce
certain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can
validly be used to infer that the event did not occur. for example:
""a flood as described in the bible would require an enormous volume of water
to be present on the earth. the earth does not have a tenth as much water,
even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles. therefore no
such flood occurred.""
in science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has
not occurred. we cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,
however.
argumentum ad misericordiam
this is the appeal to pity, also known as special pleading. the fallacy is
committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a
conclusion accepted. for example:
""i did not murder my mother and father with an axe. please don't find me
guilty; i'm suffering enough through being an orphan.""
argumentum ad populum
this is known as appealing to the gallery, or appealing to the people. to
commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by
appealing to a large group of people. this form of fallacy is often
characterized by emotive language. for example:
""pornography must be banned. it is violence against women.""
""the bible must be true. millions of people know that it is. are you trying
to tell them that they are all mistaken fools?""
argumentum ad numeram
this fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum. it consists of
asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more
likely it is that that proposition is correct.
argumentum ad verecundiam
the appeal to authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win
support for an assertion. for example:
""isaac newton was a genius and he believed in god.""
this line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference
to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a
discussion of that subject. for example, we can distinguish quite clearly
between:
""stephen hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation""
and
""john searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent
computer""
hawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black
hole radiation to be informed. searle is a linguist, so it is questionable
whether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.
the fallacy of accident
the fallacy of accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a
particular case whose ""accidental"" circumstances mean that the rule is
inapplicable. it is the error made when one goes from the general to the
specific. for example:
""christians generally dislike atheists. you are a christian, so you must
dislike atheists.""
this fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide
every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.
converse accident hasty generalization
this fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident. it occurs when one
forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not
representative of all possible cases.
for example:
""jim bakker was an insincere christian. therefore all christians are
insincere.""
sweeping generalization dicto simpliciter
a sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a
particular situation in which the features of that particular situation
render the rule inapplicable. a sweeping generalization is the opposite of a
hasty generalization.
non causa pro causa post hoc ergo propter hoc
these are known as false cause fallacies.
the fallacy of non causa pro causa occurs when one identifies something as the
cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause. for
example:
""i took an aspirin and prayed to god, and my headache disappeared. so god
cured me of the headache.""
the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc occurs when something is assumed to
be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event. for
example:
""the soviet union collapsed after taking up atheism. therefore we must avoid
atheism for the same reasons.""
cum hoc ergo propter hoc
this fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc. it asserts that
because two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves
no room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.
petitio principii
this fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the
conclusion reached.
circulus in demonstrando
this fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one
wishes to reach. often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the
fallacy appears to be a valid argument. for example:
""homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office. hence any
government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job.
therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open
to blackmail. therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government
office.""
note that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the
conclusion. an argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason
for the british secret services' official ban on homosexual employees.
another example is the classic:
""we know that god exists because the bible tells us so. and we know that the
bible is true because it is the word of god.""
complex question fallacy of interrogation
this is the fallacy of presupposition. one example is the classic loaded
question:
""have you stopped beating your wife?""
the question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not
even been asked. this trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,
when they ask questions like:
""where did you hide the money you stole?""
similarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:
""how long will this ec interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?""
or
""does the chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?""
ignoratio elenchi
the fallacy of irrelevant conclusion consists of claiming that an argument
supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do
with that conclusion.
for example, a christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the
teachings of christianity are undoubtably true. if he then argues at length
that christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he
argues he will not have shown that christian teachings are true.
sadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse
emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more
favourable light.
equivocation
equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different
meanings in the same argument. for example:
""what could be more affordable than free software? but to make sure that it
remains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a
license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.""
amphiboly
amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because
of careless or ungrammatical phrasing.
accent
accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning. in this case,
the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are
emphasized. for example, consider:
""we should not speak ill of our friends""
and
""we should not speak ill of our friends""
fallacies of composition
one fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts
of something must apply to the whole. for example:
""the bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very
lightweight.""
the other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number
of individual items is shared by a collection of those items. for example:
""a car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus. therefore cars
are less environmentally damaging than buses.""
fallacy of division
the fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition. like
its opposite, it exists in two varieties. the first is to assume that a
property of some thing must apply to its parts. for example:
""you are studying at a rich college. therefore you must be rich.""
the other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by
each item. for example:
""ants can destroy a tree. therefore this ant can destroy a tree.""
the slippery slope argument
this argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful
events. there is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the
first event.
for example:
""if we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin
and we'll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare. therefore we cannot
legalize marijuana.""
""a is based on b"" fallacies ""is a type of"" fallacies
these fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way
similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.
examples:
""isn't history based upon faith? if so, then isn't the bible also a form of
history?""
""islam is based on faith, christianity is based on faith, so isn't islam a
form of christianity?""
""cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of
animal based on carbon chemistry, so aren't dogs a form of cat?""
affirmation of the consequent
this fallacy is an argument of the form ""a implies b, b is true, therefore a
is true"". to understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for
implication given earlier.
denial of the antecedent
this fallacy is an argument of the form ""a implies b, a is false, therefore b
is false"". again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is
a fallacy.
note that this fallacy is different from non causa pro causa; the latter has
the form ""a implies b, a is false, therefore b is false"", where a does not in
fact imply b at all. here, the problem is not that the implication is
invalid; rather it is that the falseness of a does not allow us to deduce
anything about b.
converting a conditional
this fallacy is an argument of the form ""if a then b, therefore if b then a"".
argumentum ad antiquitam
this is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply
because it is old, or because ""that's the way it's always been.""
argumentum ad novitam
this is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of
asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer
than something else.
argumentum ad crumenam
the fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those
with more money are more likely to be right.
argumentum ad lazarum
the fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or
more virtuous than one who is wealthier. this fallacy is the opposite of the
argumentum ad crumenam.
argumentum ad nauseam
this is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the
more often it is heard. an ""argumentum ad nauseum"" is one that employs
constant repetition in asserting something.
bifurcation
also referred to as the ""black and white"" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when
one presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other
alternatives exist or can exist.
plurium interrogationum many questions
this fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex
question.
non sequitur
a non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises
which are not logically connected with it.
red herring
this fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue
being discussed, so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the
points being made, towards a different conclusion.
reification hypostatization
reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.
shifting the burden of proof
the burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or
proposition. shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad
ignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who
denies or questions the assertion being made. the source of the fallacy is
the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.
straw man
the straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else's position so that it
can be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,
then to conclude that the original position has been demolished. it is a
fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been
made.
the extended analogy
the fallacy of the extended analogy often occurs when some suggested general
rule is being argued over. the fallacy is to assume that mentioning two
different situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a
claim that those situations are analogous to each other.
this fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about
anti-cryptography legislation:
""i believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.""
""such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported
martin luther king.""
""are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the
struggle for black liberation? how dare you!""
tu quoque
this is the famous ""you too"" fallacy. it occurs when an action is argued to
be acceptable because the other party has performed it. for instance:
""you're just being randomly abusive.""
""so? you've been abusive too."""
