philip k. dick
philip k. dick dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short
stories and novels. his stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.
he wrote mainly sf, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than
technology. although he often believed that he had met some sort of god, he
remained sceptical. amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:
""galactic pot-healer""
a fallible alien deity summons a group of earth craftsmen and women to a
remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans. when the
deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer joe fernwright is
unable to comply. a polished, ironic and amusing novel.
""a maze of death""
noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.
""valis""
the schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of gnostic
christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of
unknown but possibly divine origin. he is accompanied by his dogmatic and
dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.
""the divine invasion""
god invades earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from
another star system. unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be
assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.
margaret atwood
""the handmaid's tale""
a story based on the premise that the us congress is mysteriously
assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it
""right"" again. the book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live
under the new christian theocracy. women's right to own property is revoked,
and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the
radio is only used for readings from the bible. crimes are punished
retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the ""old world"" are
hunted down and hanged. atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to
at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.
various authors
""the bible""
this somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized. however, it
is probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is
about. it exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one
true version.

philadelphia, usa.
a detailed and scholarly justification of atheism. contains an outstanding
appendix defining terminology and usage in this (necessarily) tendentious
area. argues both for ""negative atheism"" (i.e. the ""non-belief in the
existence of god(s)"") and also for ""positive atheism"" (""the belief in the
non-existence of god(s)""). includes great refutations of the most
challenging arguments for god; particular attention is paid to refuting
contempory theists such as platinga and swinburne.
541 pages. isbn 0-87722-642-3 (hardcover; paperback also available)
""the case against christianity"", temple university press
a comprehensive critique of christianity, in which he considers
the best contemporary defences of christianity and (ultimately)

james turner
""without god, without creed"", the johns hopkins university press, baltimore,
md, usa
subtitled ""the origins of unbelief in america"". examines the way in which
unbelief (whether agnostic or atheistic) became a mainstream alternative
world-view. focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering france
and britain the emphasis is on american, and particularly new england
developments. ""neither a religious history of secularization or atheism,
without god, without creed is, rather, the intellectual history of the fate
of a single idea, the belief that god exists.""

and writings which, explicitly or implicitly, present the person's philosophy
and world-view. includes obscure (and often suppressed) opinions from many
people. for some popular observations, traces the way in which various
people expressed and twisted the idea over the centuries. quite a number of
the quotations are derived from cardiff's ""what great men think of religion""
and noyes' ""views of religion"".

richard swinburne
""the existence of god (revised edition)"", clarendon paperbacks, oxford
this book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with ""the coherence of
theism"" (1977) and was concluded with ""faith and reason"" (1981). in this
work, swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the
existence of god. his arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely
upon the imputation of late 20th century western christian values and
aesthetics to a god which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were
decisively rejected in mackie's ""the miracle of theism"". in the revised
edition of ""the existence of god"", swinburne includes an appendix in which he
makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut mackie.
j. l. mackie
""the miracle of theism"", oxford
this (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal
arguments for and against the existence of god. it ranges from the classical
philosophical positions of descartes, anselm, berkeley, hume et al, through
the moral arguments of newman, kant and sidgwick, to the recent restatements
of the classical theses by plantinga and swinburne. it also addresses those
positions which push the concept of god beyond the realm of the rational,
such as those of kierkegaard, kung and philips, as well as ""replacements for
god"" such as lelie's axiarchism. the book is a delight to read - less
formalistic and better written than martin's works, and refreshingly direct
when compared with the hand-waving of swinburne.

51060.eml,alt.atheism,"an introduction to atheism
by mathew this article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism. whilst i
have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you
should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint. i
would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some
relevant books are listed in a companion article.
to provide a sense of cohesion and progression, i have presented this article
as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist. all the
questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped
up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created. some other
frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.
please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions
posed from a christian viewpoint. this is because the faq files reflect
questions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly christians
who proselytize on alt.atheism.
so when i talk of religion, i am talking primarily about religions such as
christianity, judaism and islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine
being. much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it
may not.
""what is atheism?""
atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of god.
some atheists go further, and believe that god does not exist. the former is
often referred to as the ""weak atheist"" position, and the latter as ""strong
atheism"".
it is important to note the difference between these two positions. ""weak
atheism"" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of god. ""strong
atheism"" is a positive belief that god does not exist. please do not
fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are ""strong atheists"".
some atheists believe in the non-existence of all gods; others limit their
atheism to specific gods, such as the christian god, rather than making
flat-out denials.
""but isn't disbelieving in god the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?""
definitely not. disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe
it to be true. not believing that something is true is not equivalent to
believing that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or
not. which brings us to agnosticism.
""what is agnosticism then?""
the term 'agnosticism' was coined by professor huxley at a meeting of the
metaphysical society in 1876. he defined an agnostic as someone who
disclaimed (""strong"") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things
must be some cause unknown and unknowable.
thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for
sure whether god exists.
words are slippery things, and language is inexact. beware of assuming that
you can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact
that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic. for example, many people
use agnosticism to mean ""weak atheism"", and use the word ""atheism"" only when
referring to ""strong atheism"".
beware also that because the word ""atheist"" has so many shades of meaning, it
is very difficult to generalize about atheists. about all you can say for
sure is that atheists don't believe in god. for example, it certainly isn't
the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out
about the universe.
""so what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?""
there are many philosophical justifications for atheism. to find out why a
particular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.
many atheists feel that the idea of god as presented by the major religions
is essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that
such a god could exist. others are atheists through scepticism, because they
see no evidence that god exists.
""but isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?""
there are many counter-examples to such a statement. for example, it is
quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than
all other prime numbers. of course, this deals with well-defined objects
obeying well-defined rules. whether gods or universes are similarly
well-defined is a matter for debate.
however, assuming for the moment that the existence of a god is not provably
impossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of
god. if we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to
show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.
if on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in
question is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid
may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing
might be found, to show that it isn't there. such an exhaustive search is
often impractical or impossible. there is no such problem with largest
primes, because we can prove that they don't exist.
therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist
unless we have evidence that they do. even theists follow this rule most of
the time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusively
prove that no unicorns exist anywhere.
to assume that god exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be
tested. we cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere god might be to
prove that he doesn't exist anywhere. so the sceptical atheist assumes by
default that god does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.
those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of god
exists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover
varieties of god described by followers of various religions. so whilst it
may be impossible to prove conclusively that no god exists, it may be
possible to prove that (say) a god as described by a particular religious
book does not exist. it may even be possible to prove that no god described
by any present-day religion exists.
in practice, believing that no god described by any religion exists is very
close to believing that no god exists. however, it is sufficiently different
that counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of
god are not really applicable.
""but what if god is essentially non-detectable?""
if god interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction
must be measurable. hence his interaction with our universe must be
detectable.
if god is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he
does not interact with our universe in any way. many atheists would argue
that if god does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no
importance whether he exists or not.
if the bible is to be believed, god was easily detectable by the israelites.
surely he should still be detectable today?
note that i am not demanding that god interact in a scientifically
verifiable, physical way. it must surely be possible to perceive some
effect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can i distinguish him
from all the other things that don't exist?
""ok, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but
isn't it still a religious belief?""
one of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is ""the
redefinition game"". the cynical view of this game is as follows:
person a begins by making a contentious statement. when person b points out
that it can't be true, person a gradually re-defines the words he used in the
statement until he arrives at something person b is prepared to accept. he
then records the statement, along with the fact that person b has agreed to
it, and continues. eventually a uses the statement as an ""agreed fact"", but
uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure
redefinitions originally needed to get b to agree to it. rather than be seen
to be apparently inconsistent, b will tend to play along.
the point of this digression is that the answer to the question ""isn't
atheism a religious belief?"" depends crucially upon what is meant by
""religious"". ""religion"" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman
controlling power -- especially in some sort of god -- and by faith and
worship. it's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of buddhism are not
""religion"" according to such a definition. atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it
categorized by worship in any meaningful sense. widening the definition of
""religious"" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of
human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as ""religious"" as well -- such as
science, politics, and watching tv.
""ok, so it's not a religion. but surely belief in atheism (or science) is
still just an act of faith, like religion is?""
firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one
actually believes in.
secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to
make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience. most atheists
try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to
questioning if experience throws them into doubt.
science has a number of core assumptions. for example, it is generally
assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers. these are
the sort of core assumptions atheists make. if such basic ideas are called
""acts of faith"", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on
acts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.
faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.
according to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of
faith. of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as
religious followers when claiming that something is ""certain"". this is not a
general tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to
state with certainty that the universe exists.
faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.
sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheism
has no beliefs. strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, as
even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or
the lack of it) when asserting that god does not exist.
""if atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?""
it is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either ""for"" or
""against"", ""friend"" or ""enemy"". the truth is not so clear-cut.
atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,
it can be said to be ""anti-religion"". however, when religious believers
speak of atheists being ""anti-religious"" they usually mean that the atheists
have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.
this categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.
atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.
most atheists take a ""live and let live"" attitude. unless questioned, they
will not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends. of
course, this may be in part because atheism is not ""socially acceptable"" in
many countries.
a few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to ""convert"" others
when possible. historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little
impact on society outside the eastern bloc countries.
(to digress slightly: the soviet union was originally dedicated to separation
of church and state, just like the usa. soviet citizens were legally free to
worship as they wished. the institution of ""state atheism"" came about when
stalin took control of the soviet union and tried to destroy the churches in
order to gain complete power over the population.)
some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see
religion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,
the government of the usa. such individuals are usually concerned that
church and state should remain separate.
""but if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,
surely that's the same as state atheism?""
the principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall
not legislate concerning matters of religious belief. in particular, it
means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of
another, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in
nature.
religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters. for
example, religious believers have historically been responsible for
encouraging many political reforms. even today, many organizations
campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as
religious campaigns. so long as they campaign concerning secular matters,
and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists
are quite happy to see them have their say.
""what about prayer in schools? if there's no god, why do you care if people
pray?""
because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things
that those who don't pray can't just ignore. also, christian prayer in
schools is intimidating to non-christians, even if they are told that they
need not join in. the diversity of religious and non-religious belief means
that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be
acceptable to all those present at any public event.
also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray. it is reasonable
to care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other
motives.
""you mentioned christians who campaign for increased foreign aid. what about
atheists? why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals? don't
atheists object to the religious charities?""
there are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can
contribute to. some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for
the sake of the practical good they do. some atheists even do voluntary work
for charities founded on a theistic basis.
most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about in
connection with charity. to them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday
matter, and so is charity. many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to say
self-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set
of religious beliefs.
to ""weak"" atheists, building a hospital to say ""i do not believe in god"" is a
rather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say ""today is not my
birthday"". why the fuss? atheism is rarely evangelical.
""you said atheism isn't anti-religious. but is it perhaps a backlash against
one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?""
perhaps it is, for some. but many people have parents who do not attempt to
force any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people
choose to call themselves atheists.
it's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a
backlash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different. on the
other hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the
expectations of others.
on the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion are
backlash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go
along with a group rather than act or think independently.
""how do atheists differ from religious people?""
they don't believe in god. that's all there is to it.
atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a
verdi requiem, even if they know the words. they may wear hawaiian shirts,
they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes. (many
buddhists lack a belief in any sort of god.) some atheists even carry a copy
of the bible around -- for arguing against, of course!
whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without
realising it. atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and
appearance.
""unexceptional? but aren't atheists less moral than religious people?""
that depends. if you define morality as obedience to god, then of course
atheists are less moral as they don't obey any god. but usually when one
talks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (""right"") and unacceptable
(""wrong"") behaviour within society.
humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must
co-operate with each other. this is a good enough reason to discourage most
atheists from ""anti-social"" or ""immoral"" behaviour, purely for the purposes
of self-preservation.
many atheists behave in a ""moral"" or ""compassionate"" way simply because they
feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans. so why do they care
what happens to others? they don't know, they simply are that way.
naturally, there are some people who behave ""immorally"" and try to use
atheism to justify their actions. however, there are equally many people who
behave ""immorally"" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their
actions. for example:
""here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: jesus christ
came into the world to save sinners... but for that very reason, i was
shown mercy so that in me... jesus christ might display his unlimited
patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive
eternal life. now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only god,
be honor and glory forever and ever.""
the above quote is from a statement made to the court on february 17th 1992
by jeffrey dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of milwaukee,
wisconsin. it seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a
religious mass-murderer. but what of more trivial morality?
a survey conducted by the roper organization found that behavior
deteriorated after ""born again"" experiences. while only 4 of respondents
said they had driven intoxicated before being ""born again,"" 12 had done
so after conversion. similarly, 5 had used illegal drugs before
conversion, 9 after. two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex
before salvation; 5 after. ""freethought today"", september 1991, p. 12. so it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral
behaviour.
""is there such a thing as atheist morality?""
if you mean ""is there such a thing as morality for atheists?"", then the
answer is yes, as explained above. many atheists have ideas about morality
which are at least as strong as those held by religious people.
if you mean ""does atheism have a characteristic moral code?"", then the answer
is no. atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person
will behave. most atheists follow many of the same ""moral rules"" as theists,
but for different reasons. atheists view morality as something created by
humans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, rather
than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.
""then aren't atheists just theists who are denying god?""
a study by the freedom from religion foundation found that over 90 of the
atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for
them. they had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible
with what they observed around them.
atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are
unbelievers through choice. the vast majority of them have spent time
studying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth. they have
made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.
this decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that
individual's personality. for a naturally sceptical person, the choice
of atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only
choice that person can honestly make.
""but don't atheists want to believe in god?""
atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them. many
of them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the
""big brother"" figure might be.
some atheists would like to be able to believe in god -- but so what? should
one believe things merely because one wants them to be true? the risks of
such an approach should be obvious. atheists often decide that wanting to
believe something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.
""but of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of god -- they are
unwilling in their souls to see!""
many, if not most atheists were previously religious. as has been explained
above, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that god
exists. many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach god.
of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that
all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.
comments such as ""of course god is there, you just aren't looking properly""
are likely to be viewed as patronizing.
certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is
vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are
being sincere if they say that they have searched for god. if you are not
willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is
futile.
""isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?""
many atheists live a purposeful life. they decide what they think gives
meaning to life, and they pursue those goals. they try to make their lives
count, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other
people who will live on. for example, an atheist may dedicate his life to
political reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.
it is a natural human tendency to look for ""meaning"" or ""purpose"" in random
events. however, it is by no means obvious that ""life"" is the sort of thing
that has a ""meaning"".
to put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually
a sensible thing to ask. some atheists believe that asking ""what is the
meaning of life?"" is as silly as asking ""what is the meaning of a cup of
coffee?"". they believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.
""so how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?""
there are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.
or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or tv.
that may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so
what? should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or
should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?
in the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned. most atheists are
unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because
it makes them feel comfortable. they put truth before comfort, and consider
that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's just
hard luck.
""don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?""
the short answer is ""no, do you?""
many atheists have been atheists for years. they have encountered many
arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of god, but they have
found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.
thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof of
the existence of god. atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely
to be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.
""so why should theists question their beliefs? don't the same arguments
apply?""
no, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar. weak atheism is
the sceptical ""default position"" to take; it asserts nothing. strong atheism
is a negative belief. theism is a very strong positive belief.
atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs
because of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,
but to everyone else.
""what sort of harm?""
religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind. it's not
just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;
think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.
imagine how that effort could be better spent.
many theists believe in miracle healing. there have been plenty of instances
of ill people being ""healed"" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines
prescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result. some theists have died
because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.
it is arguable that the catholic church's opposition to birth control -- and
condoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many
third-world countries and contributing to the spread of aids world-wide.
religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than
allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different
religion.
""those weren't real believers. they just claimed to be believers as some
sort of excuse.""
what makes a real believer? there are so many one true religions it's hard
to tell. look at christianity: there are many competing groups, all
convinced that they are the only true christians. sometimes they even fight
and kill each other. how is an atheist supposed to decide who's a real
christian and who isn't, when even the major christian churches like the
catholic church and the church of england can't decide amongst themselves?
in the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who
calls himself a christian, and uses christian belief or dogma to justify his
actions, should be considered a christian. maybe some of those christians
are just perverting christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if
the bible can be so readily used to support un-christian acts it can't be
much of a moral code? if the bible is the word of god, why couldn't he have
made it less easy to misinterpret? and how do you know that your beliefs
aren't a perversion of what your god intended?
if there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the bible, then why
should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?
sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in jesus and that he murdered
others because jesus and the bible told him to do so, we must call him a
christian.
""obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned. but since
nobody has ever proved that god does not exist, it must be very unlikely
that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.""
that does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,
positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much
harder to disprove than negative ones. nobody has ever proved that unicorns
don't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.
it is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than
it is to hold a positive assertion by default. of course, ""weak"" atheists
would argue that asserting nothing is better still.
""well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?""
unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how ""correct""
it is, or whether it ""works""; consider how many people believe in astrology,
graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.
many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in
gods. certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the
people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.
of course, there's more to religion than that. in the industrialized world,
we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when
there are perfectly adequate natural explanations. religion may have started
as a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other
purposes as well.
""but so many cultures have developed religions. surely that must say
something?""
not really. most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it's
worth remembering that religions such as buddhism and taoism lack any sort of
concept of god in the christian sense.
of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it's
rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.
""what about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded
that god exists?""
for every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who
does not. besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is
not determined by how many people believe it. also, it is important to
realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the
same way that theists view their religious leaders.
a famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but
when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight. many
respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on
subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.
""so are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates
nothing?""
not entirely. it certainly indicates that the religion in question has
properties which have helped it so spread so far.
the theory of memetics talks of ""memes"" -- sets of ideas which can propagate
themselves between human minds, by analogy with genes. some atheists view
religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by
encouraging their hosts to convert others. some memes avoid destruction by
discouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure
to keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken. some
religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by
other memes.
of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with
successful propagation of a meme. religion is not a good thing because of
the number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing
because of the number of people who have caught it.
""even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important
messages. what are the fundamental messages of atheism?""
there are many important ideas atheists promote. the following are just a
few of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some
religions.
there is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.
be especially sceptical of positive claims.
if you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to
find it.
search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.
make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.
it's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change
yourself.
just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.
if you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.
don't believe things just because you want them to be true.
and finally (and most importantly):
all beliefs should be open to question.

51119.eml,alt.atheism,"the argument goes as follows: q-oid quotes appear in john, but not in
the almost codified way they were in matthew or luke. however, they are
considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of q as such, and
not an entirely different source.
we are talking date of texts here, not the age of the authors. the usual
explanation for the time order of mark, matthew and luke does not consider
their respective ages. it says matthew has read the text of mark, and luke
that of matthew (and probably that of mark).
as it is assumed that john knew the content of luke's text. the evidence
for that is not overwhelming, admittedly.
when they are from about 200, why do they shed doubt on the order on
putting john after the rest of the three?
sure, an original together with id card of sender and receiver would be
fine. so what's that supposed to say? am i missing something?
that john was a disciple is not generally accepted. the style and language
together with the theology are usually used as counterargument.
the argument that john was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospel
of john itself. is there any other evidence for it?
one step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. compare that
to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies.
not even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources.
in other words, one does not know what the original of mark did look like
and arguments based on mark are pretty weak.
but how is that connected to a redating of john?

take your foot out of your mouth, i wondered about that already when i
was a catholic christian. the fact that the contradiction is unresolvable
is one of the reasons why i am an atheist.
believe me, i believed similar sentences for a long time. but that shows
the power of religion and not anything about its claims.
it follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used. letting evil
happen or allowing evil to take place, in this place even causing evil,
is another evil.
the omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do even
before the omnipotent has created them. there is no choice left. all is known,
the course of events is fixed.
not even for the omniscient itself, to extend an argument by james tims.
and when i am not omnipotent, how can i have free will? you have said
something about choices and the scenario gives them. therefore we have
what you define as free will.
imagine the following. i can do good to other beings, but i cannot harm them.
easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good
deeds, but don't make them long for them, so they can not feel the absence
of good as evil.
but whose case am i arguing? it is conceivable, so the omnipotent can do it.
or it would not be omnipotent. if you want logically consistent as well, you
have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first.
(deletion)
that the bible describes an omniscient and omnipotent god destroys
the credibility of the bible, nothing less.
and a lot of people would be interested in evidence for a god,
unfortunately, there can't be any with these definitions.

benedikt"
51125.eml,alt.atheism,"... yes.
well, for example, the goal of ""natural"" morality is the survival and
propogation of the species. another example of a moral system is
presented within the declaration of independence, which states that we
should be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. you see,
to have a moral system, we must define the purpose of the system. that is,
we shall be moral unto what end?
well, murder violates the golen rule, which is certainly a pillar of most
every moral system. however, i am not assuming that our current system
and the manner of its implementation are objectively moral. i think that
it is a very good approximation, but we can't be perfect.
well, ""objective"" would assume a system based on clear and fundamental
concepts, while ""arbitary"" implies no clear line of reasoning.

51130.eml,alt.atheism,"that's right, and this is pretty impossible, right? it would be ideal if
we could believe for a while, just to try out religion, and only then
determine which course of thought suits us best. but again, this is not
possible. not that religion warrants belief, but the belief carries with
it some psychological benefits. there are also some psychological
burdens, too.
well, if there were some psychological or other benefits gained from racism,
they could only be fully understood or judged by persons actually ""believing""
in racism. of course, the parallel happens to be a poor one, but you
originated it.
keith"
51131.eml,alt.atheism,"yes, and everyone thinks as you do. no one thinks that he is going to cause
or be involved in a fatal accident, but the likelihood is surprisingly high.
just because you are the man on the firing squad whose gun is shooting
blanks does not mean that you are less guilty.
you mean that killing is wrong in all but one situtation? and, you should
note that that situation will never occur. there are always other options
thank killing. why don't you just say that all killing is wrong. this
is basically what you are saying.
are you attempting to be condescending?
but, most people have found the risk to be acceptable. you are probably
much more likely to die in a plane crash, or even using an electric
blender, than you are to be executed as an innocent. i personally think
that the risk is acceptable, but in an ideal moral system, no such risk
is acceptable. ""acceptable"" is the fudge factor necessary in such an
approximation to the ideal.
keith"
51132.eml,alt.atheism,"are we talking about me, or the majority of the people that support it?
anyway, i think that ""revenge"" or ""fairness"" is why most people are in
favor of the punishment. if a murderer is going to be punished, people
that think that he should ""get what he deserves."" most people wouldn't
think it would be fair for the murderer to live, while his victim died.
perhaps you think that it is petty and pathetic, but your views are in the
minority.
where are we required to have compassion, forgiveness, and sympathy? if
someone wrongs me, i will take great lengths to make sure that his advantage
is removed, or a similar situation is forced upon him. if someone kills
another, then we can apply the golden rule and kill this person in turn.
is not our entire moral system based on such a concept?
or, are you stating that human life is sacred, somehow, and that it should
never be violated? this would sound like some sort of religious view.
once a criminal has committed a murder, his desires are irrelevant.
and, you still have not answered my question. if you are concerned about
the death penalty due to the possibility of the execution of an innocent,
then why isn't this same concern shared with imprisonment. shouldn't we,
by your logic, administer as minimum as punishment as possible, to avoid
violating the liberty or happiness of an innocent person?
keith"
51133.eml,alt.atheism,"why are only those people in favor of the system to blame. if society
accepts such a system, then each member of society is to blame when
an innocent person gets executed. those that are not in favor should
work to convince others.
and, most members of our society have accepted the blame--they've considered
the risk to be acceptable. similarly, every person who drives must accept
the blame for fatal traffic accidents. this is something that is surely
going to happen when so many people are driving. it is all a question of
what risk is acceptable. it is much more likely that an innocent person
will be killed driving than it is that one will be executed.
keith"
51142.eml,alt.atheism,"well, i've said that when an innocent person has been executed, this is
objectively a murder. however, who is at blame is another question.
it seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions--
realizing the risks--is to blame.
yes, but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing
any raondom activity. presumably, you had not isolated yourself totally
from the rest of society because of this.
and i argue that our law system is a similar risk. perhaps an innocent
person will be punished someday, but we work to prevent this. in fact,
many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment
of innocents.
but, such accidents are to be totally expected, given the numner of vehicals
on the road. again, the blame is on society.
yes, but the state is not at fault in such a case. the state can only do
so much to prevent false witnesses.
okay, so this is what you call murder. but, the question is whether or not
all such ""murders"" are wrong. are you saying that all taking of human life
is wrong, no matter what the circumstances?
but, this is basically how it works. society accepts the risk that an
innocent person will be murdered by execution. and, every member of
society shares this blame. and, most people's definitions of murder
include some sort of malicious intent, which is not involved in an
execution, is it?
murder violates the golden rule. executions do not, because by allowing
it at all, society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the
innocent victim is.
reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction
was moral or not. but, in an objective system, only the absolute truth
matters, and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth. that
is, twelve members must be convinced of a truth.
but then, if we read the minds of these people, we would know that the
conviction was unfair.
yes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all
possible information), we can't always determine the difference in our
flawed system. i think that our system is almost as good as possible,
but it still isn't objectively perfect. you see, it doesn't matter if
we know it is fair or not. objectively, it is either fair or it is not.
but what we know has no effect on an objective system.
why are you so sure?
why is your reality important?
but, we can assume that the system is fairly decent, at least most likely.
and, you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a
totally ideal and objective system.
well, we can have an ideal system, but the working system can not be ideal.
we can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to
the ideal system as possible.
yes, we all bear the responsibility. most people seem willing to do this.
we must realize the consequences of all our actions. why do you keep
separating the justice system from the pack?
i don't think our country has an objective system, but i think such an
objective system can exist, in theory. without omniscience, an objective
system is not possible in practice.

""birth announcement"" on march 7, 1993, from earth forum, compuserve
information service formal announcement
(sm)
enviroleague
a new youth movement,""enviroleague,"" was recently born, according to its
founder, boyd r. critz, iii (cis id 71611,365), of peoria, illinois.
enviroleague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in
matters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our
environment.
incorporated as an illinois not-for-profit corporation, its articles and
initial applications for a service mark have now been filed. according to
critz, its draft bylaws contain the following statement of mission and
objectives:
mission
it is the mission of enviroleague and its adult members
to foster and implement the improved education of young
people in the need to conduct their lives as stewards
of the earth, to leave the earth in a better condition
than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,
moral and ethical users of their environment. to pursue
the accomplishment of this mission, enviroleague shall
seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the
separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,
improvement, and responsible use of the environment in
which we must all live.
objectives
in pursuit of the mission of enviroleague, its primary
objectives shall be:
(1) to establish a movement involving as many
environmentally concerned organizations as
possible, said movement having as its primary
focus the education and participatory
involvement of young people in appropriate areas
of environmental concern;
(2) to develop and provide to such organizations and
their branches a full complement of program
materials for their use, including suitable
uniforms, insignia and other badges, written
ideas, syllabi and information, literature and
other items as shall seem appropriate and
desirable;
(3) to serve as a ""clearing house"" for the exchange
of program ideas, materials and information
among said organizations; and
(4) to assist environmentally concerned
organizations to recruit and train the necessary
adult leadership for their youth programs.
enviroleague will operate through three ""program divisions"" serving youth in
the elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively. service shall be
through formation of ""enviroleague teams,"" either by enviroleague itself or by
environmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a
charter to use programs developed by enviroleague.
enviroleague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders
of each local team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to
membership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper
conduct. organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain
additional standards for their own use of the program material. should such
organizations do so, enviroleague will commit itself to forming, as soon as
possible, new nearby teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to
youth membership.
enviroleague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to
contribute to developing its programs. thus, the top youth leaders of its
teams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any
local administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be
involved in similar functions at the national level.
program materials are in development at this time. copies of the ""draft""
portions of the mentor's manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the
earth forum, library 17. these files will be updated as development takes
place.
compuserve is particularly proud that enviroleague's founder chose this
electronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation.
this announcement is being made simultaneously in both the outdoor and earth
forums.
the electronic home of enviroleague is in compuserve's earth forum - go
earth - message and library areas 17, both named ""enviroleague."" subsequently, enviroleague's initial governance council has held its first
meeting. boyd critz was elected as the first enviroleague chief guardian
(equivalent to chairman of the board or ceo). he can be reached at home
(309) 675-4483 in case of real need. also, mail can be addressed to:

51152.eml,alt.atheism,"also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a
higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking. the
typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the
same inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the
other, qualitatively. but then again a measuring stick must be drawn
somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core,
than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it
expresses its own selfishness.
idle thoughts...
adam adam john cooper ""verily, often have i laughed at the weaklings who thought themselves good simply because they had no claws."""
51153.eml,alt.atheism,"let me first say that ""to believe that no gods exist"" is in fact
different than ""not believing in a god or gods"".
i will argue that your latter statement, ""i believe that no gods exist""
does rest upon faith - that is, if you are making a positive statement
that ""no gods exist"" (strong atheism) rather than merely saying i don't
know and therefore don't believe in them and don't not believe in then
(weak atheism). once again, to not believe in god is different than saying
i believe that god does not exist. i still maintain the position, even
after reading the faqs, that strong atheism requires faith.
but first let me say the following.
we might have a language problem here - in regards to ""faith"" and
""existence"". i, as a christian, maintain that god does not exist.
to exist means to have being in space and time. god does not have
being - god is being. kierkegaard once said that god does not
exist, he is eternal. with this said, i feel it's rather pointless
to debate the so called ""existence"" of god - and that is not what
i'm doing here. i believe that god is the source and ground of
being. when you say that ""god does not exist"", i also accept this
statement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. however,
in what follows i will use the phrase ""the existence of god"" in it's
'usual sense' - and this is the sense that i think you are using it.
i would like a clarification upon what you mean by ""the existence of
god"".
we also might differ upon what it means to have faith. here is what
webster says:
faith
1a: allegiance to duty or a person: loyalty
b (1): fidelity to one's promises
(2): sincerity of intentions
2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to god
(2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion
b (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof (2): complete trust
3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system of religious beliefs
syn see belief
one can never prove that god does or does not exist. when you say
that you believe god does not exist, and that this is an opinion
""based upon observation"", i will have to ask ""what observtions are
you refering to?"" there are no observations - pro or con - that
are valid here in establishing a positive belief. all observations
can only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even
be predisposed to (by predisposed i mean, for example, people whoes
partents ""believe in god"" also tend to). to actually draw a conclusion
about the ""existence"" or ""non-existence"" of god requires a leap - and
you have made this leap when you actively say ""i believe that god
does does not exist"". personally, i think that both statements are
misguided. arguing over the ""existence"" of god is precisely the wrong way
to find him (and yes, i use ""him"" because a personal god is the only
viable concept (imo) - if a person wants to use ""she"" go ahead. of course
god is neither he nor she - but we have no choice but to
anthropomorphise. if you want me to explain myself further i'll be

51156.eml,alt.atheism,"i think you mean circular, not recursive, but that is semantics.
recursiveness has no problems, it is just horribly inefficient (just ask
any assembly programmer.)
the oft-quoted line that says people should be guaranteed life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights, is a complete lie
and deception, as the very authors of that line were in the process of
proving. liberty is never free, it is always purchased at some cost,
almost always at the cost to another. whos liberty is more inalienable?
similarly for right of life. when one person must die if he is to save
another, or even a group of others, whos life is more inalienable?
that leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty,
especially for serial killers. whos life and liberty is more valuable,
the serial killer, or the victim? according to that beautiful line,
those two rights should be completely inviolate, that is, noone should be
able to remove them. this includes government. admittedly the serial
killer has restricted some people's life and or liberty, but is not his
own life liberty inviolate also? according to the declaration of independence,
it is.
oooh, i like that. it means that killing an infant is not murder because
it cannot be against its will. reason, an infant has no will as such.
similarly for people who are brain dead (easier to see), in a coma, etc.
also, under current law, accidental killing is still murder. how will you
include that?
the only real golden rule in life is, he who has the gold, makes the
rules. i.e. might makes right. that is survival. now what is wrong
with that?

51162.eml,alt.atheism,"well, i'd say that a murderer is one who intentionally committed a murder.
for instance, if you put a bullet into a gun that was thought to contain
blanks, and someone was killed with such a gun, the person who actually
performed the action isn't the murderer (but i guess this is actually made
clear in the below definition).
what do you mean by ""reasonable?"" ... yes, it is bad to include the word being defined in the definition. but,
even though the series is recursively infinite, i think the meaning can
still be deduced. math lesson deleted okay, let's look at this situation: suppose there is a longstanding
feud between two families which claim that the other committed some
travesty in the distant past. each time a member of the one family
kills a member of the other, the other family thinks that it is justified
in killing a that member of the first family. now, let's suppose that this
sequence has occurred an infinite number of times. or, if you don't
like dealing with infinities, suppose that one member of the family
goes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing. that is, there
is a never-ending loop of slayings based on some non-existent travesty.
how do you resolve this?
well, they are all murders.
now, i suppose that this isn't totally applicable to your ""problem,"" but
it still is possible to reduce an uninduced system.
and, in any case, the nested ""murderer"" in the definition of murder
cannot be infintely recursive, given the finite existence of humanity.
and, a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved. so, the
first person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily
a murderer. is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently
unreducable definition? see, in a totally objective system where all the
information is available, such a nested definition isn't really a problem.

51165.eml,alt.atheism,"i hope i gave you a fairly solid answer to this one: i simply don't agree with the embodied version of a satan who is a separate creation or a force. and there are quite physical descriptions of heaven and hell in the holy qur'an, the bible, etc. there have been times in the spiritual and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical descriptions of heaven, hell, and satan were taken quite literally and that worked for the time. as i mentioned in the tradition cited above, for example, it was sufficient in the absence of a theory about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the ""evil"" which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as ""satanic.""
which begs the question: if satan in this case is
metaphorical, how can you be certain allah is not
the same way? the bottom line here, however, is that describing a spiritual plane in human language is something like describing ""color"" to a person who has been blind from birth. you may want to read the book flatland (if you haven't already) or the dragon's egg. the first is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con- cept... some deleted for space saving when language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers, then such conventions as metaphor, allegory, and the like come to be necessary. the ""unseen"" is described in terms which have reference and meaning for the reader listener. but, like all models, a compro- mise must be made when speaking metaphorically: clarity and directness of meaning, equivalence of perception, and the like are all crippled. but what else can you do?
this is why i asked the above. how would you then
know god exists as a spirit or being rather than
just being metaphorical? i mean, it's okay to say
""well, satan is just metaphorical,"" but then you
have to justify this belief and justify that god is
not some metaphor for something else.
i say this because there are many, many instances of
satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in
the old testament book of job, or the temptor in the
new testament gospels). in the same way, god too is
described as a being (or spirit.) how am i to know
one is metaphorical and not the other.
further, belief in god isn't a bar to evil. let's
consider the case of satanists: even if satan were
metaphorical, the satanist would have to believe
in god to justify this belief. again, we have a
case where someone does believe in god, but by
religious standards, they are ""evil."" if bobby

consistent, but all the evidence that i am familiar with not only does
not support it, but indicates something far different. the earth, by
latest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for
about 3.5 billion of those years. humans have only been around for (at
most) about 200,000 years. but, the fossil evidence inidcates that life
has been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before
there were people. (yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease...
mostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) heck, not just
fossil evidence, but what we've been able to glean from genetic study shows
that disease has been around for a long, long time. if human sin was what
brought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then
how could it exist before humans? deletions uh... i know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more about
biology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. there
is no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) 'started off'
in perfect condition. it seems to adapt to its envionment, in a
collective sense. i'm really curious as to what you mean by 'the
degeneration of the genetic code'.
umm. nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and
bacteria, and they to us. only a very small percentage of microlife is
harmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby
constant in size, but the ranks keep changing. for example, bubonic
plague used to be a really nasty disease, i'm sure you'll agree. but
it still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn't do as
much damage. part of that is because of better sanitation, but even
when people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in
the past. this seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible
died off long ago, and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed',
(forgive the poor terminology, i'm an engineer, not a doctor! :- ) and
died off for lack of nearby hosts.
i could be wrong on this, but from what i gather acne is only a few
hundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer. it seems to
be getting less nasty w age...
now, wait a minute. i have a question. humans were created perfect, right?
and, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. it
seems unlikely that satan, who's making the diseases, would also gift
humans with the means to fight them off. simpler to make the diseases less
lethal, if he wants survivors. as far as i can see, our immune systems,
imperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us
by god. i want to be clear on this: are you saying that god was planning
ahead for the time when satan would be in charge by building an immune
system that was not, at the time of design, necessary? that is, god made
our immune systems ahead of time, knowing that adam and eve would sin and
their descendents would need to fight off diseases?
here's another puzzle. what, exactly, do you mean by 'perfect' in the
phrase, 'created... perfect and without flaw'? to my mind, a 'perfect'
system would be incapable of degrading over time. a 'perfect' system
that will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is not a
perfect system. at least, imho.
or is it that god did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a
bunch of gum wrappers held together with elmer's glue? that is, the
original genetic 'instructions' were perfect, but were 'written' in
inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart?
if so, why could god not have used better materials?
was god incapable of creating a system that could maintain itself,
of did it just choose not to? deletions my main point, as i said, was that there really isn't any evidence for
the explanation you give. (at least, that i'm aware of.) but, i couldn't

perhaps the biggest ""imperfection"" of the code is that it is full
of non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they
intervene with the coding regions (exons). an impressive amount of
evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is
likely that early exons represented early protein domains.
is the number of introns decreasing or increasing? it appears that
intron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually
have quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes.
on the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted
later, presents several logical difficulties. introns are removed
by a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused,
if introns are inserted. moreover, intron insertion would have
required precise targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated,
since sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mrna) are
conserved. besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a
trace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and
these are not found in or near intron sequences.
i seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and
genetics before posting ""theological arguments"" like this.
try watson's molecular biology of the gene or darnell, lodish baltimore's molecular biology of the cell for starters.
: remember, the question was posed in a theological context (why does
: god cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a
: theological perspective -- my own. it is no less valid than a purely
: scientific perspective, just different.
scientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas
theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.
: i think you misread my meaning. i said god made the genetic code perfect,
: but that doesn't mean it's perfect now. it has certainly evolved since.
for the worse? would you please cite a few references that support
your assertion? your assertion is less valid than the scientific
perspective, unless you support it by some evidence.
in fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps
more important than we've thought - for instance, sex might
have evolved as defence against parasites. (this view is supported by
computer simulations of evolution, eg tierra.)
: perhaps. i thought it was higher energy rays like x-rays, gamma
: rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.
in fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although
it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action.
: actually, neither of us ""knows"" what the atmosphere was like at the
: time when god created life. according to my recollection, most
: biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after
: all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth
: was created. it would still be too primitive to support life. i
: seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for
: the origination of life on earth. anyone with a better estimate?
i'd replace ""created"" with ""formed"", since there is no need to
invoke any creator if the earth can be formed without one.
most recent estimates of the age of the earth range between 4.6 - 4.8
billion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but
organic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years.
this would leave more than billion years for the first cells to
evolve.
i'm sorry i can't give any references, this is based on the course
on evolutionary biochemistry i attended here.
: dominion, it was no great feat for satan to genetically engineer
: diseases, both bacterial viral and genetic. although the forces of
: natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the
: degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.
again, do you want this be true, or do you have any evidence for
this supposed ""degeneration""?
i can understand scott's reaction:
: excuse me, but this is so far-fetched that i know you must be
: jesting. do you know what pathogens are? do you know what
: point mutations are? do you know that everything can come
: about spontaneously?!!!!!
:
: in response to your last statement, no, and neither do you.
: you may very well believe that and accept it as fact, but you
: cannot know that.
i hope you don't forget this: we have evidence that suggests
everything can come about spontaneously. do you have evidence against
this conclusion? in science, one does not have to believe in
anything. it is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. but the
right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so,
and not to present one's own conclusions prior to this.
theology does not use this method. therefore, i seriously doubt
it could ever come to right conclusions.
: human dna, being more ""complex"", tends to accumulate errors adversely
: affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the
: simpler dna of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in
: causing infection and disease. it is a bad combination. hence
: we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial
: diseases disorders.
you are supposing a purpose, not a valid move. bacteria and viruses
do not exist to cause disease. they are just another manifests of
a general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators
from degradiation. we are just an efficient method for our dna to
survive and replicate. the less efficient methods didn't make it
to the present.
and for the last time. please present some evidence for your claim that
human dna is degrading through evolutionary processes. some people have
claimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection,
and thus are bound to degrade. i haven't seen much evidence for either
claim.
: but then i ask, so? where is this relevant to my discussion in
: answering john's question of why? why are there genetic diseases,
: and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require
: babies to develop antibodies. is it god's fault? (the original
: question) -- i say no, it is not.
of course, nothing ""evil"" is god's fault. but your explanation does
not work, it fails miserably.
: you may be right. but the fact is that you don't know that
: satan is not responsible, and neither do i.
:
: suppose that a powerful, evil being like satan exists. would it
: be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills
: that affect mankind? i don't think so.
he could have done a much better job. (pun intended.) the problem is,
it seems no satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are
just as inevitable as any product of evolution.
: did i say that? where? seems to me like another bad inference.
: actually what you've done is to oversimplify what i said to the
: point that your summary of my words takes on a new context. i
: never said that people are ""meant"" (presumably by god) ""to be
: punished by getting diseases"". why i did say is that free moral
: choices have attendent consequences. if mankind chooses to reject
: god, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not
: expect god to protect them from adverse events in an entropic
: universe.
i am not expecting this. if god exists, i expect him to leave us alone.
i would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed
free. this is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer
is not as clear-cut as it seems to be.
what consequences would you expect from rejecting allah?
: oh, i admit it's not perfect (yet). but i'm working on it. :)
a good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.
: what does this have to do with the price of tea in china, or the
: question to which i provided an answer? biology and genetics are
: fine subjects and important scientific endeavors. but they explain
: how god created and set up life processes. they don't explain
: the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.
why is there a ""why behind""? and your proposition was something
that is not supported by the evidence. this is why we recommend
these books.
is there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? evidence
for this? if the whole universe can come into existence without
any intervention, as recent cosmological theories (hawking et al)
suggest, why do people still insist on this?
: thanks scotty, for your fine and sagely advice. but i am
: not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details
: of biology and genetics, although i'm sure i'd find it a
: fascinating subject. for i realize that the details do
: not change the big picture, that god created life in the
: beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its
: environment.
i'm sorry, but they do. there is no evidence for your big picture,
and no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation.
it can come into existence without a supreme being.

zen buddhist"
51231.eml,alt.atheism,"for many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an
epistemological consideration: what do we accept as a reliable way of
knowing? there are no known valid logical arguments for the existence
of gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist. most
philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that
must be accepted on faith. faith is belief without a sound logical
basis or empirical evidence. it is a reliable way of knowing?
there is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence
of any possibility of proof. even when we agree to take someone elses
word ""on faith"", we just mean that having found this person to be
reliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now.
if we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence
everywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about
gods?
the difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then
one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing,
rather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith
is in gods or no gods. the theist believes that faith is an acceptable
basis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at
other times, for example in his work as a scientist. the atheist
believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable
knowledge. agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than
theism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other
knowledge. without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather than
santa claus or the easter bunny?
i would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn't
require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods. i don't believe that
there is any such thing as absolute knowledge. atheism is the best and
simplest theory to fit the (lack of) facts and so should be held until
contrary evidence is found.

how the religious folk would act had they not been exposed to religion,

all atheists, in general, as well. i don't think that any of the quotes
(although i seem to have lost them) mentioned anything at all about jesus.
they advocated religion over non-religion. a specific religion was not
mentioned.
so, you are saying that all christians must believe that all other religions
should be outlawed, just because they think they are wrong? that's silly.
i think the flat-earthers are wrong, but i don't advocate their banishment.
i think that any such cost would be insignificant. i mentioned the slight
cost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by
being on our currency.
well, mottos in general don't really have purposes... i don't think it
should be removed because i think the benefit would be outweighed by the
consequences.
then you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress.
why not? it is the majority that put it there.
but do they remember the debate surrounding the motto? do they remember
that some people intended it to be a message against atheists? why don't
you include this in your little survey that you were conducting? ... what? should i ask some scientists the probability that something einstein
said about relativity is worthy? i mean, if einstein said it, there's a
good chance that it was right (at least at the time).

what strikes me as self-contradicting in the fable of lucifer's
fall - which, by the way, i seem to recall to be more speculation
than based on biblical text, but my ex rcism may be showing - is
that, as benedikt pointed out, lucifer had perfect nature, yet he
had the free will to ""choose"" evil. but where did that choice come
from?
we know from genesis that eve was offered an opportunity to sin by a
tempter which many assume was satan, but how did lucifer discover,
invent, create, call the action what you will, something that god
had not given origin to?
also, where in the bible is there mention of lucifer's free will?
we make a big fuss about mankind having free will, but it strikes me
as being an after-the-fact rationalisation, and in fact, like
salvation, not one that all christians believe in identically.
at least in my mind, salvation and free will are very tightly
coupled, but then my theology was roman catholic...
still, how do theologian explain lucifer's fall? if lucifer had
perfect nature (did man?) how could he fall? how could he execute an
act that (a) contradicted his nature and (b) in effect cause evil to
exist for the first time?

51247.eml,alt.atheism,"at the cost of repudiating the faq, i think too much is made of the
strong vs weak atheism issue, although in the context of alt.atheism,
where we're continually attacked on the basis that strong atheists
""believe"" in the non-existence of god, i think the separation is a
valid one.
to cover my arse, what i'm trying to say is that there is an
infinitely grey area between weak and strong, as well as between
strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism (i wish!). whereas i logically can only support the weak atheist position, in effect i am
a strong atheist (and wish i could be a mathematical one). to
justify my strong atheist position i believe i need only show that
the evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny
is faulty.
if i read the faq correctly, no argument for the existence of god
(generic, as represented by mainstream theologians) has ever been
found to be unassailable. to me this is adequate evidence that the real god is undefinable (or at least no definition has yet been
found to be watertight), which in turn i accept as sufficient to
base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god.
i'm a little fuzzy on the edges, though, so opinions are welcome

51254.eml,alt.atheism,"it seems to me that there is a contradiction in arguing that the bible
was ""enlightened for its times"" (i.e. closer to what we would consider
morally good based on our standards and past experience) on the one
hand i hope this summarizes this argument adequately , and on the
other hand: disclaimer: i'm speaking from the jewish perspective, where ""the bible"" means what many call the old testament, and where the interpretation is not necessarily the raw text, but instead the court cases, commentaries and traditions passed down through jewish communities. this seems the crux to me: if you judge the bible according to a long line of traditions and interpretations coming down to the current day, rather than on its own merits as a cultural artifact, then of course it will correspond more closely with more contemporary values. but if that's how the bible is actually being used today, shouldn't that be how we should judge it? if most people use scissors to cut paper, shouldn't consumer's reports test scissors for paper-cutting ability, even though scissors may have been designed originally to cut cloth?
that's possibly a good way to judge the use of the bible in teaching
jewish morality today, but it hardly seems fair to claim that this
highly-interpreted version is what was ""enlightened for its times"".
to (attempt to) extend the analogy, this is like saying that the
original scissor-makers were unusually advanced at paper-cutting for
their times, even though they only ever cut cloth, and had never even
heard of paper.
i'm not arguing that the bible is ""disgusting"", though some of the
history depicted in it is, by modern standards. however, history is
full of similar abuses, and i don't think the biblical accounts are
worse than their contemporaries--or possibly ours. on the other hand,
i don't know of any reason to think the history described in the bible
shows less abuse than their contemporaries, or ours. that complex
and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic
interpretations of that history is interesting, but i still don't
think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it
to attack condemnation of the original history.

conclude that when ""a exist"" is meaningless a does not exist. under the
pragmatic definition of truth, ""a exists"" is meaningless makes a exist
even logically false.
a problem with such statements is that one can't disprove a subjective god
by definition, and there might be cases where a subjective god would even
make sense. the trouble with most god definitions is that they include
some form of objective existence with the consequence of the gods affecting

we will grant that a god exists, and uses revelation to communicate
with humans. (said revelation taking the form (paraphrased from your

makes him take dictation, and then hides away for a few hundred years'.)
now, there exists a human who has not personally experienced a
revelation. this person observes that not only do these revelations seem
to contain elements that contradict rather strongly aspects of the
observed world (which is all this person has ever seen), but there are
many mutually contradictory claims of revelation.
now, based on this, can this person be blamed for concluding, absent
a personal revelation of their own, that there is almost certainly
nothing to this 'revelation' thing?
absent this better language, and absent observations in support of the
claims of revelation, can one be blamed for doubting the whole thing?

51278.eml,alt.atheism,"okay... i argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago. men and women are
different ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically. much
recent evidence for this statement is present in the book ""brainsex"" by
anne moir and david jessel. i recommend you find a copy and read it.
their book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic
and is well referenced.
now, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only
adequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are
different by also taking into account the ways in which men and women
are different. maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into
account that women get pregnant. it does not give women the same rules
it would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this
instance would be unjust. this is just simply an obvious example of
where men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!
now, people make the naive argument that sexism oppression.
however, maternity leave is sexist because men do not get pregnant.
men do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same
extent or degree), and therefore it is sexist. no matter however much a
man wants to get pregnant and have maternity leave, he never can. and
therefore the law is sexist. no man can have access to maternity leave,
no matter how hard he tries to get pregnant. i hope this is clear.
maternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the
sexism here just reflects the ""sexism"" of nature in making men and women
different. there are many other differences between men and women which
are far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these i
recommend you have a look at the book ""brainsex"".
your point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.
if men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically
become women! to have a womb and the other factors required for
pregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --
so your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious. you
are saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that
women can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports
my statement that maternity leave is sexist.
there is no official priesthood in islam -- much of this function is
taken by islamic scholars. there are female islamic scholars and
female islamic scholars have always existed in islam. an example from
early islamic history is the prophet's widow, aisha, who was recognized
in her time and is recognized in our time as an islamic scholar.
you have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and
i dispute it. i could go on and on about women in islam, etc., but i
recently reposted something here under the heading ""islam and women"" --
if it is still at your news-site i suggest you read it. it is reposted
from soc.religion.islam, so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism it
still might be in soc.religion.islam (i forgot what its original title
was though). i will email it to you if you like.
your statement that ""other religions are no different"" is, i think, a
statement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than
christianity and perhaps judaism.
aisha, who i mentioned earlier, was not only an islamic scholar but also
was, at one stage, a military leader.

have sex. before the go to sleep at night, they have sex. after they
escape from or fight off prdators, they have sex. sex serves a very important
social function above and beyond reproduction in this species. a species
closely related to humans. there is some indication that sex performs
a social function in humans, as well, but even if not, this shows that
such a function is not impossible .

back in the 1960s. the issue wasn't gays, but the principles were the
same. thanks for a well put testimonial. stan krieger and his kind who
think this discussion doesn't belong here and his intolerance is the
only acceptable position in scouting should take notice. the bsa has
been hijacked by the religious right, but some of the core values have
survived in spite of the leadership and some scouts and former scouts
haven't given up. seeing a testimonial like this reminds me that
scouting is still worth fighting for.
on a cautionary note, you must realize that if your experience with this

51290.eml,alt.atheism,"isn't that what i said ...
what are you taking issue with here, your remarks are merely
parenthetical to mine and add nothing useful.
: ... :
: it would seem odd if homosexuality had any evolutionary function
: (other than limiting population growth) since evolution only occurs
: when the members of one generation pass along their traits to
: subsequent generations. homosexuality is an evolutionary deadend. if i
: take your usage of the term, homophobe, in the sense you seem to
: intend, then all men are really homosexual and evolution of our
: species at least, is going nowhere.
: :
: so every time a man has sex with a woman they intend to produce children?
: hmm...no wonder the world is overpopulated. obviously you keep to the
: monty python song: ""every sperm is sacred"". and if, as you say, it has
: a purpose as a means to limit population growth then it is, by your own
: arguement, natural.
consider the context, i'm talking about an evolutionary function. one
of the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of a
species procreate, those who don't have no purpose in that context.
:
: another point is that if the offspring of each generation is to
: survive, the participation of both parents is necessary - a family must
: exist, since homosexuals do not reproduce, they cannot constitute a
: family. since the majority of humankind is part of a family,
: homosexuality is an evolutionary abberation, contrary to nature if you
: will.
: :
: well if that is true, by your own arguements homosexuals would have
: vanished years ago due to non-procreation. also the parent from single
: parent families should put the babies out in the cold now, cos they must,
: by your arguement, die.
by your argument, homosexuality is genetically determined. as to your
second point, you prove again that you have no idea what context
means. i am talking about evolution, the preservation of the species,
the fundamental premise of the whole process.
:
: but it gets worse. since the overwhelming majority of people actually
: -prefer- a heterosexual relationship, homosexuality is a social
: abberation as well. the homosexual eschews the biological imperative
: to reproduce and then the social imperative to form and participate in
: the most fundamental social element, the family. but wait, there's
: more.
: :
: read the above. i expect you to have at least ten children by now, with
: the family growing. these days sex is less to do with procreation (admittedly
: without it there would be no-one) but more to do with pleasure. in pre-pill
: and pre-condom days, if you had sex there was the chance of producing children.
: these days is just ain't true! people can decide whether or not to have
: children and when. soon they will be able to choose it's sex c (but that's
: another arguement...) so it's more of a ""lifestyle"" decision. again by
: your arguement, since homosexuals can not (or choose not) to reproduce they must
: be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children. both are
: as ""unnatural"" as each other.
yet another non-sequitur. sex is an evolutionary function that exists
for procreation, that it is also recreation is incidental. that
homosexuals don't procreate means that sex is -only- recreation and
nothing more; they serve no -evolutionary- purpose.
:
: since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some
: policy makers that they have civil rights, they are now claiming that
: their sexuality is a preference, a life-style, an orientation, a
: choice that should be protected by law. now if homosexuality is a mere
: choice and if it is both contrary to nature and anti-social, then it
: is a perverse choice; they have even less credibility than before they
: became prominent.
: :
: people are people are people. who are you to tell anyone else how to live
: their life? are you god(tm)? if so, fancy a date?
here's pretty obvious dodge, do you really think you've said anything
or do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement? i am not
telling anyone anything, i am demonstrating that there are arguments
against the practice of homosexuality (providing it's a merely an
alternate lifestlye) that are not homophobic, that one can reasonably
call it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand. i realize
of course that this comes dangerously close to establishing a value,
and that atheists are compelled to object on that basis, but if you
are to be consistent, you have no case in this regard.
:
: to characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic is to
: ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization of
: the homosexual ""life-style"". but since the charge is only intended to
: intimidate, it's really just demogoguery and not to be taken
: seriously. fact is, jim, there are far more persuasive arguments for
: suppressing homosexuality than those given, but consider this a start.
: :
: again crap. all your arguments are based on outdated ideals. likewise the
: bible. would any honest christian condemn the ten generations spawned by
: a ""bastard"" to eternal damnation? or someone who crushes his penis (either
: accidently or not..!). both are in deuteronomy.
i'm sure your comment pertains to something, but you've disguised it
so well i can't see what. where did i mention ideals, out-dated or
otherwise? your arguments are very reactionary; do you have anything
at all to contribute?
:
: as to why homosexuals should be excluded from participation in
: scouting, the reasons are the same as those used to restrict them from
: teaching; by their own logic, homosexuals are deviates, social and
: biological. since any adult is a role model for a child, it is
: incumbent on the parent to ensure that the child be isolated from
: those who would do the child harm. in this case, harm means primarily
: social, though that could be extended easily enough.
: : :
: you show me anyone who has sex in a way that everyone would describe as
: normal, and will take of my hat (puma baseball cap) to you. ""one man's meat

you miss the point entirely. things defined by contradictory language

drawn from the description are wrong, unless there is the possibility
to find the described, and draw conclusions from direct knowledge of
the described then. another possibility is to drop the contradictory
part, but that implies that one can trust the concept as presented

don't hold back; he's considered an apostate and a blasphemer.
however, it's not for his writing in the satanic verses , but for
what people have accepted as a propagandistic version of what is
contained in that book. i have yet to find one single muslim who
has convinced me that they have read the book. some have initially
claimed to have done so, but none has shown more knowledge of the book
than a superficial newsweek story might impart, and all have made
factual misstatements about events in the book.

51301.eml,alt.atheism,"from what i read, the other fellow told salameh how to put it together
over the phone. the bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated
type, so to put a (i assume complicated) sophisticated bomb together
from instructions over the phone (!) one must need some brains i would
expect.
i read this in an article in ""the australian muslim times"", the
newspaper (weekly) of the australian muslim community.
if this is true, perhaps one of the muslims based in north america (if
they see this posting) can elaborate.
i don't deny this fact.
the thrust of my argument here is that
(a) salameh is, according to us law, innocent as he has not been found
guilty in a court of law. as his guilt has not been established, it is
wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.
(b) islam teaches us not to harm innocents. if muslims -- who perhaps
have not realized that islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is not because of the teachings of islam, but rather in spite of and in contradiction to the teachings of islam. this is an important
distinction.
i should clarify what muslims usually mean when they say ""muslim"". in
general, anyone who calls themselves a ""muslim"" and does not do or
outwardly profess
something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of islam
is considered to be a muslim. thus, one who might do things contrary to
islam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly not become a
muslim. if one knowingly transgresses islamic teachings and essential
principles, though, then one does leave islam.
the term ""muslim"" is to be contrasted with ""mu'min"", which means ""true
believer"". however, whether a muslim is in reality a mu'min is
something known only by god (and perhaps that person himself). so you
will not find the term mu'min used very much by muslims in alt.atheism,
because it is not known to anybody (except myself and god), whether i,
for example, am a ""true believer"" or not. for example, i could just be
putting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to
what i write here, without anyone knowing. thus, when we say ""muslims""
we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow islam, whether in
practice they might, in ignorance, transgress islamic teachings. by
""muslim"" we do not necessarily mean ""mu'min"", or ""true believer"" in
islam.

say the car drives because i've seen it drive - i've done more
than at in fact - i've actually driven it. (now what does require
some faith is the belief that my senses give an accurate representation
of what's out there....) but there is no evidence - pro or con -
for the existence or non-existence of god (see what i have to
say below on this).
sorry if i remain skeptical - i don't believe it's entirely a
conclusion. that you have seen no evidence that there is a god
is correct - neither have i. but lack of evidence for the existence
of something is in no way evidence for the non-existence of something
(the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they
disprove evolution the establish creation). you (personally) have never
seen a neutrino before, but they exist. the ""pink unicorn"" analogy breaks
down and is rather naive. i have a scientific theory that explains the
appearance of animal life - evolution. when i draw the conclusion that
""pink unicorns"" don't exist because i haven't seen them, this conclusion
has it's foundation in observation and theory. a ""pink unicorn"", if
it did exist, would be qualitatively similar to other known entities.
that is to say, since there is good evidence that all life on earth has
evolved from ""more primitive"" ancestors these pink unicorns would share
a common anscestory with horses and zebras and such. god, however,
has no such correspondence with anything (imo). there is no physical
frame work of observation to draw any conclusions from.
i disagree with you profoundly on this. i haven't defined god as
existence - in fact, i haven't defined god. but this might be
getting off the subject - although if you think it's relevant
we can come back to it.
you are using wrong categories here - or perhaps you misunderstand
what i'm saying. i'm making no argument what so ever and offering no
definition so there is no fallacy. i'm not trying to convince you of
anything. i believe - and that rests upon faith. and it is inappropriate
to apply the category of logic in this realm (unless someone tells you
that they can logically prove god or that they have ""evidence"" or ...,
then the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary).
btw, an incomplete argument is not a fallacy - some things are not
even wrong.
i don't follow you here. certainly one can make observations of
things that they didn't know existed. i still maintain that one
cannot use observation to infer that ""god does not exist"". such
a positive assertion requires a leap.
once again you seem to completely misunderstand me. i have no
evidence that ""'god is' is meaningful"" at any level. maybe such
a response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so
many people try to run their own private conception of god down
your throat. i, however, am not doing this. i am arguing one, and
only one, thing - that to make a positive assertion about something
for which there can in principle be no evidence for or against
requires a leap - it requires faith. i am, as you would say, a
""theist""; however, there is a form of atheism that i can respect -
but it must be founded upon honesty.

jim,
there are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread
that are a little confusing. an atheist is one for whom all things can
be understood as processes of nature - exclusively. there is no need
for any recourse to divnity to describe or explain anything. there is
no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by
physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is
determnined.
this would also have to include human intelligence of course and all
its products. there is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it
acquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident. for an atheist, no
event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less
value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-
an event can have value.
the products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,
from teaching, training, observation and experience and are only
significant to the individual mind wherein they reside. these mental
processes and the images they produce for us are just electrical
activity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. the human
mind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a
hill.
how then can an atheist judge value? what is the basis for criticizing
the values ennumerated in the bible or the purposes imputed to god? on
what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? it
seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you
have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what
in nature can serve that purpose? what law of nature can you invoke to
establish your values.
since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what
difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or
otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. the only
way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the
objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it
- that's it. any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer
that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries
no weight in any ""absolute"" sense.
that you don't like what god told people to do says nothing about god
or god's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your
nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled
with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. that your
objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been
conditioned; there is no ""truth"" content. the whole of your
intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.
i didn't make these rules, it's inherent in naturalistic atheism and
to be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human
thought, even your own. all of this being so, you have excluded
yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,
etc. and cannot participate. your opinion about the bible can have no
weight whatsoever.

one must approach the qur'an with intelligence. any thinking approach
to the qur'an cannot but interpret the above verse and others like it
that women and men are spiritual equals.
i think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have
souls. does it make any sense for something without a soul to be
forgiven? or to have a great reward (understood to be in the
after-life)? i think the usual answer would be no -- in which case, the

says they have souls.

i have no idea what a soul is.)
as for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority
in all interpretations, any thinking approach to the qur'an has to give
all verses of the qur'an equal priority. that is because, according to
muslim belief, the whole qur'an is the revelation of god -- in fact,
denying the truth of any part of the qur'an is sufficient to be
considered a disbeliever in islam.
look, any approach to the qur'an must be done with intelligence and
thought. it is in this fashion that one can try to understand the
quran's message. in a book of finite length, it cannot explicitly
answer every question you want to put to it, but through its teachings
it can guide you. i think, however, that women are the spiritual equals
of men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse, and that
since women can clearly be ""forgiven"" and ""rewarded"" they must have
souls (from the above verse).
let's try to understand what the qur'an is trying to teach, rather than
try to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this
passage or that passage. the misinterpretations of the qur'an based on
ignoring this verse or that verse are infinite, but the interpretations
fully consistent are more limited. let's try to discuss these
interpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can
ignore this bit or that bit, for that is just showing how people can try
to twist islam for their own ends -- something i do not deny -- but
provides no reflection on the true teachings of islam whatsoever.

51319.eml,alt.atheism,"you misrepresent me, selim. the hard evidence for my statements about
his lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book
""orientalism"" by edward said. edward said, by the way, is a christian,
not a muslim.
regarding bernard lewis:
him being a zionist gives him a political motive for his
giving misrepresentations and half-truths about islam.
read ""orientalism"" by edward said -- see the evidence for yourself.
in fact, i may post some of it here (if it isn't too long).
i haven't read lewis's article, so i can't comment directly upon it, and
have only spoken about his writings in general so far, that his
political motives make him a biased writer on islam. his anti-islamic
polemics, as i understand it, are often quite subtle and are often based
on telling half-truths.
again, read ""orientalism"" by edward said. i am not asking you to take
what i say on trust, in fact i am urging you not to do so but to get
this book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for yourself .
if slavery is in reality (as opposed to in the practice of some
muslims) opposed by islam, then using slaves for sexual
purposes is necessarily opposed too.
i understand your point of view, selim -- i think, rather, it is us who are not getting through to you .
some of the points you repeat above i have already answered before.
regarding women, i have made posting after posting on this subject,
showing that islam is not anti-woman, etc. however, have you been
completely ignoring my postings or just missing them? i just reposted a
very good one, under the title ""islam and women"", reposted from
soc.religion.islam. if this has already disappeared from your site,
then please email me telling me so and i will email you a copy of this
excellent article.
imho, your understanding of the issue of women in islam is sadly deficient.
regarding slaves, my posting on slavery -- the second one i made,
which is a repost of an article i wrote early last year -- is based
completely on the qur'an and contains numerous qur'anic verses and
hadiths to support its point of view.
our approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical
standpoint and i am arguing directly from the teachings of the qur'an
and hadiths. now, just because people say they are muslims and perform
a particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is
part of islam, even if it is opposed by the qur'an and sunnah? no! of
course not.
let me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for
you. the qur'an prohibits drinking. now, if a person says ""i am a
muslim"" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean
that islam teaches that people should drink beer? of course not, and
only an idiot would think so.
do you see my point?
you are judging islam here on capitalist terms. capitalism is an
ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise
their wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to islamic teachings.
to say islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --
islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be
capitalist. (this does not mean that islam does not support a
free-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of
capitalism which are opposed to islam as i understand it.)
one can postulate numerous reasons for this. your theory is that it is
because islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.
selim, i will give you a clear historical example to show you the
fallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that
islam lack of education and power.
for a large part of history, the islamic world was very powerful. for a
significant section of history, the islamic world was the foremost in
the sciences. so to say that islam is, for example, anti-education is
completely absurd. you try to blame this situation on islam -- history
shows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be
other reasons for this situation.
well, selim, your viewpoint on women in islam makes me question the extent
of your knowledge of islam. i really think you are not
knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the muslims are
following the qur'an or not.
the islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one
stage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by ""following the qur'an""
that muslims are backwards in education. selim, it is your thesis
that is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical
fact which contradicts your theory.
you have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.
so far, it seems to me that your view on islam being anti-education is
quite contrary to history. that you are so convinced of your views
makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of
this.
i think, selim, you should consider taking your own advice.
here too.
selim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate
ignorance, not only of islam but also of islamic history (particularly
with respect to muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so i
think). yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!
selim, if i remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that
you are an apostate from islam. i think you should slow down and start
thinking clearly about the issues, and start reading some of our
postings about islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously
have.

51320.eml,alt.atheism,"i think the problem here is that i pretty much ignored the part
about the jews sightseeing for 2000 years, thinking instead that
the important part of what the original poster said was the bit
about killing palestinians. in retrospect, i can see how the
sightseeing thing would be offensive to many. i originally saw
it just as poetic license, but it's understandable that others
might see it differently. i still think that ken came on a bit
strong though. i also think that your advice to masud khan: before you argue with someone like mr arromdee, it's a good idea to do a little homework, or at least think.
was unnecessary.
throughout all your articles in this thread there is the tacit
assumption that the original poster was exhibiting casual
anti-semitism. if i agreed with that, then maybe your speech
on why this is bad might have been relevant. but i think you're
reading a lot into one flip sentence. while probably not
true in this case, too often the charge of anti-semitism gets
thrown around in order to stifle legitimate criticism of the

subject: what is the purpose of this newsgroup?
typical posting:
why have a newsgroup about atheism? why do atheists organize in groups?
what is there to discuss?
response:
many things are discussed here, including: whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's
family prayer in schools discrimination against atheists sunday trading laws the satanic child abuse myth whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet' how religious societies prey (sic) on new college students how to get rid of unwanted proselytizers whether religion is a danger to society and or the individual why people become atheists
of course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical christians
looking for someone to convert. most readers of the newsgroup don't
want to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure
from tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.
subject: hitler was an atheist!
typical posting:
hitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!
response:
adolf hitler was emphatically not an atheist. as he said himself:
the folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in
his own denomination, of making people stop just talking superficially of god's will, and actually fulfill god's will, and not let god's word be desecrated. orig. ital. for god's will gave men their form, their essence, and their
abilities. anyone who destroys his work is declaring war on the
lord's creation, the divine will. therefore, let every man be
active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every
man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who
in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his
religious community and tries to butt into the other. ... hence today i believe that i am acting in accordance with the will
of the almighty creator: by defending myself against the jew, i am fighting for the work of the lord. orig. ital. of course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief
wrong. it's also entirely possible that hitler was lying when he claimed
to believe in god. we certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist,
though.
subject: the bible proves it
typical posting:
in the bible it says that...
response:
most of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the bible is of questionable
accuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were
recording oral tradition that existed many years before. thus, any claimed
'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy. this isn't to say that the
bible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being
accepted.
many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is
subject to ""interpretation"", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and
one thing only is not legitimate.
note that this feeling tends to extend to other books.
it is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other
equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.
subject: pascal's wager
typical posting:
if you believe in god and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --
but if you don't believe in god and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to
hell. therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.
response:
this argument is known as pascal's wager. it has several flaws.
firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow. indeed, there are
many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there. this is often
described as the ""avoiding the wrong hell"" problem. if a person is a
follower of religion x, he may end up in religion y's version of hell.
secondly, the statement that ""if you believe in god and turn out to be
incorrect, you have lost nothing"" is not true. suppose you're believing in
the wrong god -- the true god might punish you for your foolishness.
consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in
favour of prayer.
another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that
the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of
comparable likelihood. if, in fact, the possibility of there being a god
is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive. so sadly the
argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.
also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on
evidence, with some amount of intuition. it is not a matter of will or
cost-benefit analysis.
formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:
1. one does not know whether god exists.
2. not believing in god is bad for one's eternal soul if god does
exist.
3. believing in god is of no consequence if god does not exist.
4. therefore it is in one's interest to believe in god.
there are two approaches to the argument. the first is to view 1 as an
assumption, and 2 as a consequence of it. one problem with this approach, in
the abstract, is that it creates information from no information. this is
considered invalid in information theory. statement 1 indicates one has no
information about god -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information
can be gained from the absolute lack of information about god. this violates
information entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at
no ""cost"".
the alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions. the
problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the
christian position, and only a christian will agree with that assumption. the
argument thus collapses to ""if you are a christian, it is in your interests
to believe in god"" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way pascal
intended the argument to be viewed.
the biggest reason why pascal's wager is a failure is that if god is
omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as
a wager. he will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all
whether people believe in him.
subject: what is occam's razor?
typical posting:
people keep talking about occam's razor. what is it?
response:
william of occam formulated a principle which has become known as occam's
razor. in its original form, it said ""do not multiply entities
unnecessarily."" that is, if you can explain something without supposing
the existence of some entity, then do so.
nowadays when people refer to occam's razor, they generally express it
more generally, for example as ""take the simplest solution"".
the relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations
for what we see around us:
1. there is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which
came into being as a result of natural processes.
2. there is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and
there is also a god who created the universe. clearly this god must be
of non-zero complexity.
given that both explanations fit the facts, occam's razor might suggest
that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.
unfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:
3. there isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.
we just imagine that there is.
this third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people
find unacceptable.
subject: why it's good to believe in jesus
typical posting:
i want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.
response:
preaching is not appreciated.
feel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that
are on a ""conversion"" theme. such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and
will be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup
talk.religion.misc).
you would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite
newsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would
have them do unto you!
often theists make their basic claims about god in the form of lengthy
analogies or parables. be aware that atheists have heard of god and know the
basic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell
atheists that god exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,
since it tells us nothing we have not been told before.
subject: why i know that god exists
typical posting:
i know from personal experience and prayer that god exists.
response:
just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship
exists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not
exist. that evidence varies from person to person.
furthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many
people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been
abducted by ufos, visited by the ghost of elvis, and so on.
subject: einstein and ""god does not play dice""
typical posting:
albert einstein believed in god. do you think you're cleverer than him?
response:
einstein did once comment that ""god does not play dice with the universe "".
this quotation is commonly mentioned to show that einstein believed in the
christian god. used this way, it is out of context; it refers to einstein's
refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. furthermore,
einstein's religious background was jewish rather than christian.
a better quotation showing what einstein thought about god is the following:
""i believe in spinoza's god who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of
what exists, not in a god who concerns himself with fates and actions of
human beings.""
einstein was unable to accept quantum theory because of his belief in an
objective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random
events and which would not be dependent upon the observer. he believed that
qm was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for
statistical interpretations. so far no such better theory has been found,
and much evidence suggests that it never will be.
a longer quote from einstein appears in ""science, philosophy, and religion, a
symposium"", published by the conference on science, philosophy and religion
in their relation to the democratic way of life, inc., new york, 1941. in
it he says:
""the more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events
the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side
of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature. for him
neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an
independent cause of natural events. to be sure, the doctrine of a
personal god interfering with natural events could never be refuted italics his , in the real sense, by science, for this
doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific
knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.
but i am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives
of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal. for a doctrine
which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,
will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm
to human progress. in their struggle for the ethical good, teachers
of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal
god, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past
placed such vast power in the hands of priests. in their labors they
will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable
of cultivating the good, the true, and the beautiful in humanity
itself. this is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably
more worthy task...""
einstein has also said:
""it was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,
a lie which is being systematically repeated. i do not believe in a
personal god and i have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.
if something is in me which can be called religious then it is the
unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our
science can reveal it.""
the latter quote is from ""albert einstein: the human side"", edited by helen
dukas and banesh hoffman, and published by princeton university press.
also from the same book:
""i do not believe in immortality of the individual, and i consider ethics
to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind
it.""
of course, the fact that einstein chose not to believe in christianity does
not in itself imply that christianity is false.
subject: everyone worships something
typical posting:
everyone worships something, whether it's money, power or god.
response:
if that is true, everyone is a polytheist. theists care just as much about
those things that atheists care about. if the atheists' reactions to (for
example) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.
subject: why there must be a causeless cause
typical posting:
sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so
chains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.
response:
the set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has
no smallest member.
further, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does
not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and
especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by
any particular religion.
subject: the universe is so complex it must have been designed
typical posting:
the presence of design in the universe proves there is a god. surely you
don't think all this appeared here just by chance?
response:
this is known as the argument from design.
it is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the
universe. those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living
creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the
newsgroup talk.origins for a while.
there is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.
however, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of
so-called scientific creationism. furthermore, there is much evidence,
observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the
universe and life on earth.
the origin of the argument by design is a feeling that the existence of
something as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that
surely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some
external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos
deliberately.
but if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind
capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must
be immeasurably more unlikely? the approach used to argue in favour of the
existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the creationist
position.
this leads us to the familiar theme of ""if a creator created the universe,
what created the creator?"", but with the addition of spiralling
improbability. the only way out is to declare that the creator was not
created and just ""is"" (or ""was"").
from here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe
just ""is"" without introducing a creator? indeed stephen hawking, in his book
""a brief history of time"", explains his theory that the universe is closed
and finite in extent, with no beginning or end.
the argument from design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called
watchmaker argument. one is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on
the beach. does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it
evolved naturally? of course one assumes a watchmaker. yet like the
watch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the
universe too must have a creator.
the watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above
those common to all arguments by design. firstly, a watchmaker creates
watches from pre-existing materials, whereas god is claimed to have
created the universe from nothing. these two sorts of creation are
clearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.
secondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in
the world. if we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear
reactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker. the argument
would therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a
different part of creation.
finally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that
the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore
stands out from the randomness of nature. yet in the second part of the
argument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not
random, but shows elements of order. the watchmaker argument is thus
internally inconsistent.
subject: independent evidence that the bible is true
typical posting:
the events of the new testament are confirmed by independent documentary
evidence. for example...
response:
the writings of josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary
evidence.
early versions of josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned jesus or
james; the extant version discusses john in a non-christian context. many
scholars believe that the original mentioned jesus and james in passing, but
that this was expanded by christian copyists. several ""reconstructions"" of
the original text have been published to this effect.
much information appears in the ecclesiastical history of eusebius (about 320
c.e.). it is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate
falsification of the wily eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the
first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' it is eusebius who is
generally given the title of authorship for this material.
aside from the new testament, the biographical information about jesus is
more well-documented. for further information, please consult the frequently
asked questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.
subject: godel's incompleteness theorem
typical posting:
godel's incompleteness theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the
bible to be both true and complete.
response:
godel's first incompleteness theorem says that in any consistent formal
system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary
arithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be
valid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system. (technically
speaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision
procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal
system.)
essentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a ""liar
paradox."" the classic liar paradox sentence in ordinary english is ""this
sentence is false."" note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal
system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.
the logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims
that godel's incompleteness theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to
prove or disprove) the existence of god are worthless in isolation.
one can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the
existence of god, simply by having the existence of god stated as an axiom.
this is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.
it may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms
that both atheists and theists agree with. it may then be possible to show
that godel's incompleteness theorem holds for that system. however, that
would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that god exists
within the system. furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about
whether it is possible to prove the existence of god generally.
note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about
the actual existence of god; the formal systems are just abstractions.
another frequent claim is that godel's incompleteness theorem demonstrates
that a religious text (the bible, the book of mormon or whatever) cannot be
both consistent and universally applicable. religious texts are not formal
systems, so such claims are nonsense.
subject: george bush on atheism and patriotism
typical posting:
did george bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?
response:
the following exchange took place at the chicago airport between robert i.
sherman of american atheist press and george bush, on august 27 1988. sherman
is a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of
the press corps. the republican presidential nominee was there to announce
federal disaster relief for illinois. the discussion turned to the
presidential primary:
rs: ""what will you do to win the votes of americans who are atheists?""
gb: ""i guess i'm pretty weak in the atheist community. faith in
god is important to me.""
rs: ""surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of
americans who are atheists?""
gb: ""no, i don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,
nor should they be considered patriots. this is one nation under
god.""
rs: ""do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation
of state and church?""
gb: ""yes, i support the separation of church and state. i'm just not
very high on atheists.""
upi reported on may 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were
still angry over the remarks.
the exchange appeared in the boulder daily camera on monday february 27,
1989. it can also be found in ""free enquiry"" magazine, fall 1988 issue,
volume 8, number 4, page 16.
on october 29, 1988, mr. sherman had a confrontation with ed murnane,
cochairman of the bush-quayle '88 illinois campaign. this concerned a
lawsuit mr. sherman had filed to stop the community consolidated school
district 21 (chicago, illinois) from forcing his first-grade atheist son to
pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states as ""one nation under god""
(bush's phrase). the following conversation took place:
rs: ""american atheists filed the pledge of allegiance lawsuit yesterday.
does the bush campaign have an official response to this filing?""
em: ""it's bullshit.""
rs: ""what is bullshit?""
em: ""everything that american atheists does, rob, is bullshit.""
rs: ""thank you for telling me what the official position of the bush
campaign is on this issue.""
em: ""you're welcome.""
after bush's election, american atheists wrote to bush asking him to retract
his statement. on february 21st 1989, c. boyden gray, counsel to the
president, replied on white house stationery that bush substantively stood by
""as you are aware, the president is a religious man who neither supports
atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or
supported by the government.""

subject: i know where hell is!
typical posting:
i know where hell is! hell is in norway!
response:
there are several towns called ""hell"" in various countries around the
world, including norway and the usa. whilst this information is mildly
amusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now
getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.
subject: biblical contradictions wanted
typical posting:

subject: the usa is a christian nation
typical posting:
because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn't the
united states be considered a christian nation?
response:
based upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear
that they never intended the us to be a christian nation. here are some
quotes; there are many more.

subject: the usa is not a christian nation
typical posting:
is it true that george washington said that the united states is not in any
sense founded upon the christian religion?
response:
no. the quotation often given is in fact from article xi of the 1797 treaty
of tripoli (8 stat 154, treaty series 358):
article 11
as the government of the united states of america is not in any sense
founded on the christian religion, -- as it has in itself no character of
enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of musselmen, -- and as
the said states never have entered into any war or act of hostility
against any mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no
pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption
of the harmony existing between the two countries.
the text may be found in the congressional record or in treaty collections
such as charles bevans' ""treaties and other international agreements of the
united states of america 1776-1949"", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).
the english text of the treaty of tripoli was approved by the u.s. senate on
june 7, 1797 and ratified by president john adams on june 10, 1797. it was
recently discovered that the arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the
quotation, it lacks article xi altogether.
the person who translated the arabic to english was joel barlow, consul
general at algiers, a close friend of thomas paine -- and an opponent of
christianity. it is possible that barlow made up article xi, but since there
is no arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.
in 1806 a new treaty of tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the
quotation.

52909.eml,alt.atheism,"constructing a logical argument
although there is much argument on usenet, the general quality of argument
found is poor. this article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to
logic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.
logic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference concise
oed . logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether
it is correct or not (valid or invalid). of course, one does not need to
study logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic
knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an
argument.
note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally
applicable. the matter is very much open for debate. this document merely
explains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is
the right tool for the job.
propositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. a
proposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, ""it is
raining"" or ""today is tuesday"". propositions may be either asserted (said to
be true) or denied (said to be false). note that this is a technical meaning
of ""deny"", not the everyday meaning.
the proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular
arrangement of words used to express it. so ""god exists"" and ""there exists a
god"" both express the same proposition.
an argument is, to quote the monty python sketch, ""a connected series of
statements to establish a definite proposition"". an argument consists of
three stages.
first of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to
continue are stated. these are called the premises of the argument. they
are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions.
premises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as ""because"",
""since"", ""obviously"" and so on. (the phrase ""obviously"" is often viewed with
suspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious
premises. if something doesn't seem obvious to you, don't be afraid to
question it. you can always say ""oh, yes, you're right, it is obvious"" when
you've heard the explanation.)
next, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known
as inference. in inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of
one or more other propositions already accepted. there are various forms of
valid inference.
the propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further
inference. inference is often denoted by phrases such as ""implies that"" or
""therefore"".
finally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which
is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference. conclusions are often
indicated by phrases such as ""therefore"", ""it follows that"", ""we conclude""
and so on. the conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.
for example:
every event has a cause (premise)
the universe has a beginning (premise)
all beginnings involve an event (premise)
this implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)
therefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)
note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another
argument. a proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with
respect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.
sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,
the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated
afterwards in support of the conclusion. this is perfectly valid, if
sometimes a little confusing.
recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or
conclusions. many people shower their writing with assertions without ever
producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument. some
statements look like arguments, but are not. for example:
""if the bible is accurate, jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,
or the son of god.""
this is not an argument, it is a conditional statement. it does not assert
the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its
conclusion. (it also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we'll
come to those later.)
another example:
""god created you; therefore do your duty to god.""
the phrase ""do your duty to god"" is not a proposition, since it is neither
true nor false. therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an
argument.
finally, causality is important. consider a statement of the form ""a because
b"". if we're interested in establishing a and b is offered as evidence, the
statement is an argument. if we're trying to establish the truth of b, then
it is not an argument, it is an explanation.
for example:
""there must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not
start."" -- this is an argument.
""my car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.""
there are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive. a
deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions
also be true. a deductive argument is either valid or invalid. a valid
argument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the
conclusion is true.
an inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the
truth of the conclusion. inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;
however, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other
arguments, and about how probable their premises are.
there are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive
nor inductive. however, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive
arguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.
it is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does
not imply that its conclusion holds. this is because of the slightly
counter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more
carefully.
obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions. however, an
argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions.
for example:
all insects have wings (premise)
woodlice are insects (premise)
therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)
here, the conclusion is not true because the argument's premises are false.
if the argument's premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true.
the argument is thus entirely valid.
more subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,
as in:
all fish live in the sea (premise)
dolphins are fish (premise)
therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)
however, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid
inference from true premises. we can therefore draw up a ""truth table"" for
implication.
the symbol "" "" denotes implication; ""a"" is the premise, ""b"" the conclusion.
""t"" and ""f"" represent true and false respectively.
premise conclusion inference
a b a b
f f t if the premises are false and the inference
f t t valid, the conclusion can be true or false.
t f f if the premises are true and the conclusion
false, the inference must be invalid.
t t t if the premises are true and the inference valid,
the conclusion must be true.
a sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true. a sound
argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion. be careful not to confuse
valid arguments with sound arguments.
to delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require
lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy. it is simpler and probably
more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing
an argument. these pitfalls are known as fallacies.
in everyday english the term ""fallacy"" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs
as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs. this is fair
enough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of
technically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or
convincing.
so for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical
argument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect
when examined more closely. by studying fallacies we aim to avoid being
misled by them. the following list of fallacies is not intended to be
exhaustive.
argumentum ad baculum (appeal to force)
the appeal to force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the
threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion. it
is often used by politicians, and can be summarized as ""might makes right"".
the force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.
for example:
""... thus there is ample proof of the truth of the bible. all those who
refuse to accept that truth will burn in hell.""
argumentum ad hominem
argumentum ad hominem is literally ""argument directed at the man"".
the abusive variety of argumentum ad hominem occurs when, instead of trying
to disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or
people making the assertion. this is invalid because the truth of an
assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.
for example:
""atheism is an evil philosophy. it is practised by communists and murderers.""
sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by
showing, for example, that he is a known perjurer. this is a valid way of
reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not
argumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness's
testimony is false. to conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the
argumentum ad ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).
the circumstantial form of argumentum ad hominem is committed when a person
argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of
the opponent's particular circumstances.
for example:
""it is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food. how can you argue
otherwise when you're quite happy to wear leather shoes?""
this is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing
the opponent's argument.
this fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion. for
example:
""of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing.
you're white.""
this particular form of argumentum ad hominem, when one alleges that one's
adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is
also known as ""poisoning the well"".
argumentum ad ignorantium
argumentum ad ignorantium means ""argument from ignorance"". this fallacy
occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it
has not been proved false. or, equivalently, when it is argued that
something must be false because it has not been proved true. (note that this
is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved
true, a basic scientific principle.)
examples:
""of course the bible is true. nobody can prove otherwise.""
""of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist. nobody has
shown any proof that they are real.""
note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is
generally assumed innocent until proven guilty.
also, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce
certain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can
validly be used to infer that the event did not occur. for example:
""a flood as described in the bible would require an enormous volume of water
to be present on the earth. the earth does not have a tenth as much water,
even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles. therefore no
such flood occurred.""
in science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has
not occurred. we cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,
however.
argumentum ad misericordiam
this is the appeal to pity, also known as special pleading. the fallacy is
committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a
conclusion accepted. for example:
""i did not murder my mother and father with an axe. please don't find me
guilty; i'm suffering enough through being an orphan.""
argumentum ad populum
this is known as appealing to the gallery, or appealing to the people. to
commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by
appealing to a large group of people. this form of fallacy is often
characterized by emotive language. for example:
""pornography must be banned. it is violence against women.""
""the bible must be true. millions of people know that it is. are you trying
to tell them that they are all mistaken fools?""
argumentum ad numeram
this fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum. it consists of
asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more
likely it is that that proposition is correct.
argumentum ad verecundiam
the appeal to authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win
support for an assertion. for example:
""isaac newton was a genius and he believed in god.""
this line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference
to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a
discussion of that subject. for example, we can distinguish quite clearly
between:
""stephen hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation""
and
""john searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent
computer""
hawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black
hole radiation to be informed. searle is a linguist, so it is questionable
whether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.
the fallacy of accident
the fallacy of accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a
particular case whose ""accidental"" circumstances mean that the rule is
inapplicable. it is the error made when one goes from the general to the
specific. for example:
""christians generally dislike atheists. you are a christian, so you must
dislike atheists.""
this fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide
every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.
converse accident hasty generalization
this fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident. it occurs when one
forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not
representative of all possible cases.
for example:
""jim bakker was an insincere christian. therefore all christians are
insincere.""
sweeping generalization dicto simpliciter
a sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a
particular situation in which the features of that particular situation
render the rule inapplicable. a sweeping generalization is the opposite of a
hasty generalization.
non causa pro causa post hoc ergo propter hoc
these are known as false cause fallacies.
the fallacy of non causa pro causa occurs when one identifies something as the
cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause. for
example:
""i took an aspirin and prayed to god, and my headache disappeared. so god
cured me of the headache.""
the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc occurs when something is assumed to
be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event. for
example:
""the soviet union collapsed after taking up atheism. therefore we must avoid
atheism for the same reasons.""
cum hoc ergo propter hoc
this fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc. it asserts that
because two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves
no room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.
petitio principii
this fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the
conclusion reached.
circulus in demonstrando
this fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one
wishes to reach. often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the
fallacy appears to be a valid argument. for example:
""homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office. hence any
government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job.
therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open
to blackmail. therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government
office.""
note that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the
conclusion. an argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason
for the british secret services' official ban on homosexual employees.
another example is the classic:
""we know that god exists because the bible tells us so. and we know that the
bible is true because it is the word of god.""
complex question fallacy of interrogation
this is the fallacy of presupposition. one example is the classic loaded
question:
""have you stopped beating your wife?""
the question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not
even been asked. this trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,
when they ask questions like:
""where did you hide the money you stole?""
similarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:
""how long will this ec interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?""
or
""does the chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?""
ignoratio elenchi
the fallacy of irrelevant conclusion consists of claiming that an argument
supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do
with that conclusion.
for example, a christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the
teachings of christianity are undoubtably true. if he then argues at length
that christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he
argues he will not have shown that christian teachings are true.
sadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse
emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more
favourable light.
equivocation
equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different
meanings in the same argument. for example:
""what could be more affordable than free software? but to make sure that it
remains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a
license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.""
amphiboly
amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because
of careless or ungrammatical phrasing.
accent
accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning. in this case,
the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are
emphasized. for example, consider:
""we should not speak ill of our friends""
and
""we should not speak ill of our friends""
fallacies of composition
one fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts
of something must apply to the whole. for example:
""the bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very
lightweight.""
the other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number
of individual items is shared by a collection of those items. for example:
""a car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus. therefore cars
are less environmentally damaging than buses.""
fallacy of division
the fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition. like
its opposite, it exists in two varieties. the first is to assume that a
property of some thing must apply to its parts. for example:
""you are studying at a rich college. therefore you must be rich.""
the other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by
each item. for example:
""ants can destroy a tree. therefore this ant can destroy a tree.""
the slippery slope argument
this argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful
events. there is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the
first event.
for example:
""if we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin
and we'll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare. therefore we cannot
legalize marijuana.""
""a is based on b"" fallacies ""is a type of"" fallacies
these fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way
similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.
examples:
""isn't history based upon faith? if so, then isn't the bible also a form of
history?""
""islam is based on faith, christianity is based on faith, so isn't islam a
form of christianity?""
""cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of
animal based on carbon chemistry, so aren't dogs a form of cat?""
affirmation of the consequent
this fallacy is an argument of the form ""a implies b, b is true, therefore a
is true"". to understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for
implication given earlier.
denial of the antecedent
this fallacy is an argument of the form ""a implies b, a is false, therefore b
is false"". again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is
a fallacy.
note that this fallacy is different from non causa pro causa; the latter has
the form ""a implies b, a is false, therefore b is false"", where a does not in
fact imply b at all. here, the problem is not that the implication is
invalid; rather it is that the falseness of a does not allow us to deduce
anything about b.
converting a conditional
this fallacy is an argument of the form ""if a then b, therefore if b then a"".
argumentum ad antiquitam
this is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply
because it is old, or because ""that's the way it's always been.""
argumentum ad novitam
this is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of
asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer
than something else.
argumentum ad crumenam
the fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those
with more money are more likely to be right.
argumentum ad lazarum
the fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or
more virtuous than one who is wealthier. this fallacy is the opposite of the
argumentum ad crumenam.
argumentum ad nauseam
this is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the
more often it is heard. an ""argumentum ad nauseum"" is one that employs
constant repetition in asserting something.
bifurcation
also referred to as the ""black and white"" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when
one presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other
alternatives exist or can exist.
plurium interrogationum many questions
this fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex
question.
non sequitur
a non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises
which are not logically connected with it.
red herring
this fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue
being discussed, so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the
points being made, towards a different conclusion.
reification hypostatization
reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.
shifting the burden of proof
the burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or
proposition. shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad
ignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who
denies or questions the assertion being made. the source of the fallacy is
the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.
straw man
the straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else's position so that it
can be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,
then to conclude that the original position has been demolished. it is a
fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been
made.
the extended analogy
the fallacy of the extended analogy often occurs when some suggested general
rule is being argued over. the fallacy is to assume that mentioning two
different situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a
claim that those situations are analogous to each other.
this fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about
anti-cryptography legislation:
""i believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.""
""such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported
martin luther king.""
""are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the
struggle for black liberation? how dare you!""
tu quoque
this is the famous ""you too"" fallacy. it occurs when an action is argued to
be acceptable because the other party has performed it. for instance:
""you're just being randomly abusive.""
""so? you've been abusive too."""

a 1 bit mac plus screen using this method. displaying all 256 levels
synchronized to the 60hz display took about 10 seconds. after
experimenting with different aperture settings and screen
brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable
contrast. the quality of the images was pretty good. there were no
visible contrast bands.
to minimize the exposure time the display program built 255
different 1 bit frames. the first contained a dot only for pixels
that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254,
etc. these frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was
very fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. creating these
frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old mac, but the camera
shutter was closed during that time anyway. and yes, we wrote
directly to the screen memory. mea culpa.
our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the
top left corner of the screen instead of the center. it took
an extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the
processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into
the center of the print. who'd have guessed?

37931.eml,comp.graphics,"i use xwd xpr (from the x11r5 dist.) and various programs of the ppm-tools to print hardcopies of colored x windows. my problem is,
i don't like xpr. it gives (at least, the x11r4 version does) louzy
output: the hardcopy looks very grainy to me.
instead, i use pnmtops. this takes full advantage postscript, and
lets the printer do the dirty job of dithering a (graylevel)
image to black and white dots.
so: if you have a postscript printer, try:
xwdtopnm convert to ppm ppmtopgm .. to graylevel for smaller file to print
pnmtops -noturn .. to postscript
lpr print
pnmtops has several neat options, but use them with care:
if you want your image to be 4"" wide, use:
pnmtops -noturn -scale 100 -width 4
-noturn prevents the image from being rotated (if it is wider than it
is high)
-width 4 specifies the paper width (not the image width - see below)
-scale 100 is used because if the image is small, it may fit within a
width less than 4"", and will thus be printed smaller than 4"" wide.
if you first scale it up a lot, it will certainly not fit in 4"", and
will be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified
paper width.
in short: pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size,
but it will not blow it up automatically.
hope this helps.

37948.eml,comp.graphics,"look for edge inconsistencies. consider two vertices, p and q, which
are connected by at least one edge.
if (p,q) is an edge, then (q,p) should not appear.
if both (p,q) and (q,p) appear as edges, then the surface ""flips"" when
you travel across that edge. this is bad.
assuming (warning...warning...warning) that you have an otherwise
acceptable surface - you can pick an edge, any edge, and traverse the
surface enforcing consistency with that edge.
0) pick an edge (p,q), and mark it as ""ok""
1) for each face, f, containing this edge (if more than 2, oops)
make sure that all edges in f are consistent (i.e., the face
should be (p,q),(q,r),(r,s),(s,t),(t,p) ). flip those which
are wrong. mark all of the edges in f as ""ok"",
and add them to a queue (check for duplicates, and especially
inconsistencies - don't let the queue have both (p,q) and (q,p)).
2) remove an edge from the queue, and go to 1).
if a marked edge is discovered to be inconsistent, then you lose.
if step 1) finds more than one face sharing a particular edge, then you
lose.
otherwise, when done, all of the edges will be consistent. which means
that all of the surface normals will either point in or out. deciding
which way is out is left as an exercise...

37949.eml,comp.graphics,"this algorithm works well for me:
algorithm to attempt to find outward-facing normals:
first, mark all faces as unknown.
then create an edge dictionary that allows you to find all of the
faces sharing a given edge (where an edge is two integers representing
the two shared vertices).
pick an arbitrary face and mark it counter clockwise. using the edge
dictionary, orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation of
this face. and recurse for all surrounding faces, consistently
orienting the entire surface.
find the average of the vertices in this surface. using that point,
calculate a volume measurement, taking into account the face's
orientation. if the volume turns out to be positive, assume the faces
are oriented correctly. if it is negative, reverse their orientations
(mark them clockwise).
if any faces are still unknown after this, choose another face
and go through the algorithm again.
at the end, faces marked clockwise must have their indices reversed
before facet normals are found.

calculations, or big computer programs in general. i don't argue
that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, i
just question whether you should .
the fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we
can't model should be replaced with a random number generator. that
has been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to human
perception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but i don't
think it has much to do with fractals, and i certainly would rather
that the model be improved in a more explicable manner.
i guess i just haven't seen all these earth-shaking fractal models
that explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists. i
really hope i do, but i'm not holding my self-similar breath.
uh huh. i'll believe it when i see it. i've been chasing fractal
compression for a few years, and i still don't believe in it. if it's so
great, how come we don't see it competing with jpeg? 'cause it can't,
i'll wager.
actually, i have wagered, i quit trying to make fractal compression
work- and i was trying- because i don't think it's a reasonable
alternative to other techniques. it is neat, though. :-)
i'll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal. that's why i
don't think fractal compression as it is widely explained is
practical. i know barnsley and sloan have some tricks up their
sleeves that make their demos work, but i don't see anyone using it in a
real product. it's been six years since iterated systems was formed,
right?
""there are always going to be questions until there's a product
out there,"" sloan replies. the company plans to ship its first
encoding devices in the summer, he says. in march, iterated
systems will have the other half of the system: the decoders.

dmpeg v1.0
public domain mpeg decoder
by stefan eckart
0. features dmpeg dmplay is another mpeg decoder player for the pc:
- decodes (nearly) the full mpeg video standard
(i,p,b frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)
- saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display
- optional on-screen display during decoding (requires vga)
- several dithering options: ordered dither, floyd-steinberg, grayscale
- color-space selection
- runs under dos, 640kb ram, no ms-windows required
- very compact (small code small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)
- real time display of the raw file by a separate player for
vga and many super-vgas
...
4. technical information the player is a rather straightforward implementation of the mpeg spec 1 .
the idct is based on the chen-wang 13 multiplication algorithm 2 (not quite the optimum, i know). blocks with not more than eight non-zero
coefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2d-idct
(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'
algorithm in this (quite common) case. dithering is pretty standard. main
difference to the berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported
algorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to
use a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation
dominant ordered dither. this leads to a significantly superior quality of
the dithered image (i claim, judge yourself).
restricted color-space means that the u and v components are clipped to -0.25 (instead of -0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed
over this restricted space. since the distance between color-space points
is thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the
expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.
saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying
somewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated
by primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of
constant saturation. this yields subjectivly better quality due to the
lower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than
to hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the pal tv standard to improve
on ntsc). the improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish
areas.

intersection between a line and a polygon (undecidable??),
by dave baraff, tom duff
from: newsgroups: comp.graphics
keywords: p, np, jordan curve separation, ursyhon metrization theorem
organization: program of computer graphics
i think that this is a very difficult problem. to start with, lines and
polygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of
points. here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.
first, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated. now, the
jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into
exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions. thus, the line lies
completely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,
or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.
now, the phrasing of this question says ""if a line intersects a polygon"", so
this is a decision problem. one possibility (the decision model approach) is
to reduce the question to some other (well known) problem q, and then try to
solve q. an answer to q gives an answer to the original decision problem.
in recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a
new language called postscript. (see ""postscript language"", by adobe systems
incorporated, isbn 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).
so, given a line l and a polygon p, we can write a postscript program that
draws the line l and the polygon p, and then ""outputs"" the answer. by
""output"", we mean the program executes a command called ""showpage"", which
actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon. a quick
examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem q, and thus
the original problem.
there are two small problems with this approach.
(1) there is an infinite number of ways to encode l and p into the
reduced problem q. so, we will be forced to invoke the axiom of
choice (or equivalently, zorn's lemma). but the use of the axiom of
choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.
(2) more importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the
postscript program q will actually output a piece of paper; or in
other words, will it halt?
now, postscript is expressive enough to encode everything that a
turing machine might do; thus the halting problem (for postscript) is
undecidable. it is quite possible that the original problem will turn
out to be undecidable.
i won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite
precision and running out of ink, paper or both.

summary: overkill.
organization: at t bell laboratories, murray hill nj
the situation is not nearly as bleak as baraff suggests (he should know
better, he's hung around the labs for long enough). by the well known
dobbin-dullman reduction (see j. dullman d. dobbin, j. comp. obfusc.
37,ii: pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to
hamiltonian circuit, without(!) the use of grobner bases, so lpi (to coin an
acronym) is probably only np-complete. besides, turing-completeness will no
longer be a problem once our cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to
complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)
from: (david baraff)
well, sure its no worse than np-complete, but that's only if you restrict
yourself to the case where the line satisfies a lipschitz condition on its
second derivative. (i think there's an '89 siggraph paper from caltech that
deals with this).

38249.eml,comp.graphics,"basically, there are two algorithms determining whether a point is inside,
outside or on the polygon. the first one is ray (or half line) method. in
this method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection point
of the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. if the number is odd,
then it is inside. of cause, you have to deal with the special cases which
may make you headache.
the second method is pi algorithm. draw the lines between the point and
all the vertices on the polygon. calculate and sum the angles of the
successive lines. if the result is 2 pi, then it is inside. if pi, then
it is on the polygon. otherwise it is outside.
my experience tells the second method is relible.
hope this helps.

38257.eml,comp.graphics,"i'm the virtual reality market manager for silicon graphics, so perhaps i
can help a little.
unfortunately, while sgi systems were used to create the special effects
for both terminator 2 and lawnmower man, those are film-quality computer
graphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time. each
frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on
high-end parallel processing computer systems. thus, that level of graphics
would be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames
per second).
it depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.
true immersive visualization (vr), requires the rendering of complex visual
databases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second. this
is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot
training. if the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of
the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion
of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous. thus the graphics system
must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex
data representations.
additionally, the frame rate must be constant. if the system renders 15
frames per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps
due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was
visible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the
graphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. to maintain a constant
frame rate, the system must be able to run in real-time. unix in general
does not support real-time operation, but silicon graphics has modified the
unix kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time
operation, bypassing the usual unix process priority-management schemes.
uniprocessor systems running unix cannot fundamentally support real-time
operation (not sun sparc10, not hp 700 series systems, not ibm rs-6000, not
even sgi's uniprocessor systems like indigo or crimson). only our
multiprocessor onyx and challenge systems support real-time operation due
to their symmetric multi-processing (smp) shared-memory architecture.
from a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments
requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time
multi-sample anti-aliasing. of all of the general purpose graphics systems
on the market today, only crimson realityengine and onyx realityengine2
systems fully support these capabilities. the anti-aliasing is particularly
important, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an
unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.
you can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop
vr applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level. there are
off-the- shelf software packages available to get you going much faster,
being targeted directly at the vr application developer. some of the most
popular are (in no particular order):

38259.eml,comp.graphics,"i thought that some people may be interested in my vr
software on these groups: announcing the release of multiverse-1.0.2 multiverse is a multi-user, non-immersive, x-windows based virtual reality
system, primarily focused on entertainment research.
features:
client-server based model, using berkeley sockets.
no limit to the number of users (apart from performance).
generic clients.
customizable servers.
hierachical objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).
multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).
objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily
attached.
functionality:
client:
the client is built around a 'fast' render loop. basically it changes things
when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's
viewpoint. it also provides the server with information about the user's
actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to
other users.
the client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to
develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. this means that
resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting
it. the adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.
this release of the client software supports the following functionality:
o hierarchical objects (with associated addressing)
o multiple light sources and types (ambient, point and spot)
o user interface panels
o colour polygonal rendering with phong shading (optional wireframe for
faster frame rates)
o mouse and keyboard input
(some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the
powerglove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because
i don't have one! this will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)
server(s):
this is where customization can take place. the following basic support is
provided in this release for potential world server developers:
o transparent client management
o client message handling
this may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of
accepting and
terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the
application writer
can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.
things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. this is
what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:
o server selectable extension installation:
what this means is that you can decide which objects have extended
functionality in your world. basically you call the extension
initialisers you want.
o event handler registration:
when you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback
functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.
(current events supported: init, move, change, collide terminate)
o collision detection registration:
if you want your object to respond to collision events just provide
some basic information to the collision detection management software.
your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.
this software is kept separate from the worldserver applications because
the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects
from which to choose.
the following is all you need to make a world server application:
o provide an initworld function:
this is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus
any initialization you want to do.
o provide a positionobject function:
this is where you determine where to place a new client.
o provide an installworldobjects function:
this is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.
o provide a getworldtype function:
this is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.
o provide an animateworld function:
this is where you can go wild! at a minimum you should let the objects
move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit
(to avoid outrunning the clients).
that's all there is to it! and to prove it here are the line counts for the
three world servers i've provided:
generic - 81 lines
dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the
stairs! will probably be improved with future
versions)
dogfight - 72 lines
location:
this software is located at the following site:
ftp.u.washington.edu
directory:
pub virtual-worlds
file:
multiverse-1.0.2.tar.z
futures:
client:
o texture mapping.
o more realistic rendering: i.e. z-buffering (or similar), gouraud shading
o hmd support.
o etc, etc....
server:
o physical modelling (gravity, friction etc).
o enhanced object management interaction
o etc, etc....
both:
o improved comms!!!
i hope this provides people with a good understanding of the multiverse
software,
unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and i'm not sure
whether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(
i hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of
the virtual universe - i've certainly found fascinating developing it, and i
would love to add support for the powerglove...and an hmd :-)!!
finally one major disclaimer:
this is totally amateur code. by that i mean there is no support for this code
other than what i, out the kindness of my heart, or you, out of pure
desperation, provide. i cannot be held responsible for anything good or bad
that may happen through the use of this code - use it at your own risk!
disclaimer over!
of course if you love it, i would like to here from you. and anyone with
positive contributions criticisms is also encouraged to contact me. anyone who
hates it: dev null! and if anyone wants to let me do this for a living: you know where to

38277.eml,comp.graphics,"i agree with you about the upgrade path; but i think i was fair.
the original posting complained (1) about sgi coming out with newer (and
better) architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones,
and (2) that dec did.
on statement (1), i merely attempted to point out that all computer
companies are constantly attempting to improve their product ( market
position share). in so doing, they eventually come to a point where they
have a new architecture, and the only upgrade path is to replace the
system. and the particular system he was complaining about was (in
computer lifetimes) relatively old.
on statement (2), i felt dec's history of providing upgrades was not far
superior than the industry ""average"", and that, in my opinion, sgi's
history is better than dec's.

going to ""abandon"" it for their alpha based line, or provide an upgrade

38292.eml,comp.graphics,"no. that's not what i was complaining about, nor did i intend to
suggest that dec was any better than sgi (let me tell you about the
lynx some day, but be prepared with a large sedative if you do...). my
comment regarding dec was to indicate that i might be open to other vendors
that supported opengl, rather than deal further with sgi.
what i am annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that
we would be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the
crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.
i'm also annoyed about being sold several personal irises at a
previous site on the understanding that architecture would be around
for a while, rather than being flushed.
now i understand that sgi is responsible to its investors and has to
keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that i found myself
pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books
just before the end of the quarter), but i'm just a little tired of
getting boned in the process.
maybe it's because my lab buys sgis in onesies and twosies, so we
aren't entitled to a ""peek under the covers"" as the big kids (nasa,
for instance) are. this lab, and i suspect that a lot of other labs
and organizations, doesn't have a load of money to spend on computers
every year, so we can't be out buying new systems on a regular basis.
the boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the
entire grant period of five years and, in some case, beyond. that
means that i need to buy the best piece of equipment that i can when i
have the money, not some product that was built, to paraphrase one
previous poster's words, 'to fill a niche' to compete with some other
vendor. i'm going to be looking at this box for the next five years.
and every time i look at it, i'm going to think about sgi and how i
could have better spent my money (actually your money, since we're
supported almost entirely by federal tax dollars).
now you'll have to pardon me while i go off and hiss and fume in a
corner somewhere and think dark, libelous thoughts.

directory: info-mac source binhex 3d-grafsys-121.hqx date: fri, 5 mar 93 14:13:07 0100
from: christian steffen ove franz to: subject: 3d grafsys 1.21 in incoming directory
a 3d grafsys short description follows:
programmers 3d grafsys vers 1.21 now available.
version 1.21 is mainly a bugfix for think c users. this version
now runs with think c, i promise! the docs now contain a chapter for
c programmers on how to use the grafsys. if you have problems, feel free
to contact me.
the other change is that i removed the fastperftrig calls from
the fpu version to make it run faster.
those of you who don't know what all this is about, read on. programmers 3d grafsys -- what it is:
didn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of
drawing three-dimensional scenes?
didn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure
of three-dimensional molecules?
and didn't the task of writing your 3d conversions routines keep you from
actually doing it?
well if the answer to any of the above questions is 'yes, but what has it to
do with this package???' , read on.
grafsys is a think pascal c library that provides you with simple routines
for building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating
(independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling)
three dimensional objects. objects, not just simple single-line drawings.
grafsys supports full 3d clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-
line hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within your program.
grafsys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel
projections (if you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing
off for those who know about it. the docs that come with it will try to explain
what it all means later on).
grafsys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with
data so you can use grafsys to do the 3d transformations and your own routines
to do the actual drawing. (note that grafsys also provides drawing routines so
you don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)
grafsys 1.11 comes in two versions. one for the 881 and 020 or above
processors. the other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any mac.
both versions are 100 source compatibel .
grafsys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3d
graphics and how to use the package.
if demand is big enough i will convert the grafsys to an object-class library.
however, i feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for
a lot more people than the select 'oop-guild'.
grafsys is free for any non-commercial usage. read the documentation enclosed.
enjoy,
christian franz"

38304.eml,comp.graphics,"opengl is a graphics programming library and as such is a great, portable
interface for the development of interactive 3d graphics applications. it
is not, however, an indicator of performance, as that will vary strongly
from machine to machine and vendor to vendor. sgi is committed to high
performance interactive graphics systems and software tools, so opengl
means that you can port easily from sgi to other platforms, there is no
guarantee that your performance would be comparable.
if your sales representative truly mislead you, then you should have a
valid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local sgi
sales management team. feel free to contact the local branch manager...we
understand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers, so give it a
shot.
as one of the previous posts stated, the personal iris was introduced in
1988 and grew to include the 4d 20, 4d 25, 4d 30 and 4d 35 as clock rates
sped up over time. as a rule of thumb, sgi platforms live for about 4-5
years. this was true of the motorola-based 3000 series ('85-'89), the pi
('88-'93), the professional series (the early 4d's - '86-'90), the power
series parallel systems ('88-'93). individual cpu subsystems running at a
particular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. new graphics
architectures at the high end (gt, vgx, realityengine) are released every
18 months to 2 years.
these are the facts of life. if we look at these machines, they become
almost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a new
platform (like indigo, onyx, challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths,
faster cpus, faster graphics and i o, and larger disk capacities. if we
don't, we become uncompetitive.
from the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets your
current needs and makes economic sense today. you can't wait to buy, but
if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the sales rep
for one in writing. if it's feasible, they should be able to do that. some
of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such as
the performance protection program for older r3000-based power series
multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain
a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new onyx or challenge
r4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.
if that's happening, it's becausing of misunderstandings or
mis-communication, not because sgi is directly attempting to annoy our
customer base.
most sgi customers are onesy-twosey types, but regardless, we rarely give a
great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because
again, like a previous post stated, if we pre-announced and the schedule
slipped, we would mess up our potential customers schedules (when they were
counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date) and
would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial
analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our
commitments.
five years is an awfully long time in computer years. new processor
technologies are arriving every 1-2 years, making a 5 year old computer at
least 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times. the competitive nature
of the market is demanding that rate of development, so if your timing is
really 5 years between purchases, you have to accept the limited viability
of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor.
there are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live
with, but keeping customers happy is the most important, so don't give up,
we know it.

38310.eml,comp.graphics,"as the author of multiverse, i feel i had better respond to your
mailnote questioning whether anyone had managed to compile this
software - the quick answer is yes! the long answer is yes - but a
few have had a few problems with their platforms - not all unix's are
the same, you know! as far as ""many bugs"" go, it would probably be more
useful to everyone (including you) if you were a bit more explicit! :-)
platforms it has succesfully compiled and run on are: rs6000, dec ultrix
sun solaris so it is possible.
the main problem is that i don't have access to other platforms than the
rs6000, so if there are portability problems then the only way i hear
about them is by people letting me know and giving me a clue as to
how to fix it.
as far as the software not doing anything, do you really think i would
bother releasing it, if that was the case? perhaps you didn't read the
few docs that are supplied. the dogfight world is made up of clients
only, so if you're in there on your own, then you're not going to see
anything! the dactyl world has quite a lot of scenary - so if you don't
see anything there, then this is definitely a problem!
one final word - if you're not interested, don't bother with it.
if you are interested, then please remember that i'm not asking for
any money! so why not try a little patience and constructive criticism,
maybe that will get results??

38316.eml,comp.graphics,"i've made a vga mode 13h graphics library available via ftp. i originally
wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someone
here will find them useful. they are certainly useable as they are, but
are missing some higher-level functionality. they're intended more as an
intro to mode 13h programming, a starting point. the library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it for a 286. if enough people ask, i'll make the mods and re-post it as a different version.
the routines are written in assembly (tasm) and are callable from c. they
are fairly simple, but i've found them to be very fast (for my purposes,
anyway). routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a
""virtual screen"", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image with
no transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copy
areas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc. i've also included a
simple c routine to draw a line, as well as a c routine to load a 256
color gif image into a buffer. i also wrote a quick'n'dirty(tm) demo program
that bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three ""windows"".

38320.eml,comp.graphics,"it's not a bad question: i don't have any refs that list this algorithm
either. but thinking about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard.
1) take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as
the circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)
2) find the center of this circle. the line passing through this center
perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of
the sphere.
3) repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. this
gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere's
origin. their interection is the center of the sphere.
4) the radius is easy to compute, it's just the distance from the center to
any of the original points.
i'll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)
an alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed
by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the
center of the sphere. three pairs will form three planes, intersecting
at a point. this might be easier to implement.

10011.eml,comp.os.ms-windows.misc,"this file includes information on writing a script for university of minnesota
phone, and also a batch file hack that lets you use other packet drivers with
phone.
for additions, modifications and corrections, i can be reached at best wishes,
ashok
based on my experiences on setting up slip under dos and windows, here
are my comments on setting up slip in this environment. i thank the
trumpet beta testers and the cwru slip beta testers for their comments.
configuring your modem:
a) turn off dtr (at d0 w)
i have to disable dtr because the communication program that i use
to dial my slip server (qmodem) drops dtr when i exit the program
and therefore hangs up the line. if you use a program like kermit
or conex to establish the slip connection, then this need not be done.
these programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit.
note: if you use univ. of minn. phone to dial and establish a
slip connection, you do not need to turn off dtr.
b) dial and establish the slip connection first. this can be done
automatically if you use a program like phone (from the university of
minnesota) which will dial and establish a slip connection then load the
slip packet driver. the phone scripting language is simple and
phone scripts can be easily written to configure phone to work with
other slip server. in addition, while the only packet driver
that phone works with is umslip (currently), it is easy to write a
batch file hack that lets phone work with other packet drivers.
there is a section on phone in the document with both script and
batch file examples.
configuring the slip drivers:
there are five slip packet drivers commonly available
cslipper.exe peter tattam's compressed slip driver
slipper.exe peter tattam's slip driver
slip8250.com crynwr driver (i like phil burn's modified driver)
ethersl.com crynwr driver (ethernet simulation over slip)
umslip.com univ. of minnesota driver (based on slip8250)
of these four, i vastly prefer c slipper.exe over slip8250.com or
ethersl.com for the following reasons:
a) it is much faster even though my modem has just a 16450 uart
b) while using etherslip slip8250 umslip, myself and several others
have noticed that the pc clock gets messed up after performing a
long ftp transfer.
c) it supports pktmux when used in ethernet simulation mode
d) when used in ethernet simulation mode c slipper seem to work with
every tcp ip application that i have tested it with.
instructions for c slipper.exe (and you do not use phone)
a) load slipper in your autoexec.bat file according to instructions:
for instance if you have a v.32bis modem on com1
slipper com1 vec 62 baud 57600
b) if you use dos tcp ip applications in win 3.1 dos boxes, then use the
double-ended packet driver shim winpkt.com -- this creates a virtual
packet driver at 0x60. dos applications in native mode, dos
applications in windows 3.1 dos boxes and windows applications can all
use this virtual driver at 0x60.
winpkt.com 0x60 0x62
c) if you use qvt net, load pktint.com next. qvt net is configured in
qvtnet.ini to use the interrupt at 0x60.
pktint.com
instructions for slip8250.com:
a) try getting a version 10 slip driver. philip burns of northwestern
university has a modified slip8250.com driver that is better at hardware
handshaking. this driver is distributed along with nupop.
b) load the driver after establishing the slip connection. my modem is a
v.32bis modem on com1, so here is how i would load the driver.
slip8250 -w 0x62 -h 4 slip 0x03f8 57600
c) as discussed above if you use dos tcp ip applications in windows 3.x
dos boxes, you probably want to use winpkt.com
winpkt.com 0x60 0x62
d) if you use winqvt net, load pktint.com
pktint.com
instructions for ethersl.com:
if you choose to use ethersl.com instead of slip8250.com, the
instructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference. you
will have to delete the line ""device vcd"" from the 386enh section
of system.ini. this will interfere with running regular windows comm
applications (such as crosstalk), and you will get lots of dropped
characters etc. in these applications. this is therefore not
recommended. etherslip would be loaded as:
ethersl -w 0x62 -h 4 0x03f8 57600
configuring windows 3.1:
a) make the following modifications to the system.ini file 386enh section.
i) list all your com ports, with their addresses and interrupts.
com1base 03f8
com1irq 4
com2base 02f8
com2irq 3
com3base 03e8
com3irq 5
this can also be done from within windows - control panel,
but double-clicking on the ""ports"" icon.
ii) give the port to which your modem is attached a generous com buffer
com1buffer 10000
iii) change the com port autoassign value for the com port that you wish
to use for your modem to zero. this is the amount of time that
windows waits in seconds before handing control of that com port to
another application. if you use winqvt net and then want to switch
from one session to another, and this value is at the default value
of 2 seconds, you are will get a gpf and windows will crash.
com1autoassign 0
this can also be done from within windows - control panel.
double-click on 386 enhanced, and under ""device contention"", set
the device contention for the com port your modem is on to
""never warn""
additional notes:
what to do if you are assigned a different ip address for each
slip session?
i am fortunate in that our campus slip server assigns each user
a permanent ip address, so i do not have worry about editing qvtnet.ini
each time that i establish a slip connection.
if you are assigned a new ip address on every occasion that you dial in,
please try to use bootp aware software, and let bootp do the
configuration for you. however, qvtnet is not bootp aware and rarp
will not work over a slip connection. to get qvtnet working in a
situation such as this, you must do the following:
edit the qvtnet.ini file. let the net section look like this: net name ip netmask 255.255.255.0 (or whatever is appropriate for you)
arptime 20
packet vector 60 (or whatever is appropriate)
save the changes, and then write-protect this file
""attrib r qvtnet.ini""
start your slip connection, and remember the name and ip address
that you are assigned. each time you start qvt net 3.1x, the
general configuration dialog box will open. enter the name and
ip address and you were assigned for that session, click on ok ,
and you should be up and running. the changes you make will not
be saved, as qvtnet.ini is write-protected.
a more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic slip ip address
assignment is provided by victor menayang victor uses the program bootpq to semi-automate qvtnet preparation.
bootpq is used to inquire the assigned ip, which is then saved to a
file called ""myip"". another file ""noip"" is essentially a complete
qvtnet.ini file that lacks the ip address. in the final step ""myip""
and ""noip"" are copied into a single qvtnet.ini file. an example of
victor's batch file is provided below: slipper com2
pktint.com
bootpq -i ""ip "" s """" myip
bootpq -i ""my ip is: s""
copy q net myip noip e: com qvtnet qvtnet.ini
del q myip echo off
echo .
echo ready to run winqvtnet for questions and more details about bootpq, please contact victor
menayang qpc software is attempting to add bootp capability to winqvt net.
how do you use pktmux over slip?
pktmux will not work over the slip8250.com packet driver, and crashes
immediately if used with ethersl.com
pktmux will work with c slipper.exe, when c slipper is used in ethernet
simulation mode. an example of this configuration is shown below:
the latest release of pktmux is 1.2c; and it is important that you
use this version, if you want to use virtual packet drivers with
applications like trumpet for windows (to be released very shortly). from autoexec.bat lh c slipper com1 vec 65 baud 57600 ether (packet driver)
lh pktmux 5 65 5 (pktmux loaded for 5 virtual packet drivers)
lh pktdrv 7f 65 (first virtual packet driver used for qvt net)
lh pktint.com (qvt net pktint.com)
pktdrv 63 65 (pktdrv for use in native dos or wintrumpet)
additional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from within
windows 3.1 dos boxes. for example, my pif file to load popmail is
directed to the file ""popmail.bat"". this is what popmail.bat reads
like:
pktdrv 60 65 loads a virtual packet driver at 0x60
cd popmail
popmail
cd pktdrv 60 u unloads the packet driver at 0x60
exit causes the dos window to close
i have similar batch files that load other dos tcp ip applications
like pc gopher. it is my experience that pktmux works fine
even if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual dos
sessions, are loaded at the same software interrupt. for example
within two different dos boxes -- one for popmail and the other for
gopher, the virtual packet driver (pktdrv) is loaded at 0x60 in each
instance.
how much does pktmux degrade the performance of c slipper?
i have a v.32bis v.42bis modem in a 386-33 running windows 3.1 with
a reasonably fast video card (ati graphics ultra). under these
conditions, when i have three virtual packet drivers loaded and
being used as follows:
a) driver at 0x7f -- qvtnet ftp client session
b) driver at 0x60 in one dos window -- cutcp tn3270 session
c) driver at 0x60 in another dos window -- trumpet for dos
i get ftp transfer rates of 0.8 - 1.0 kb sec while transferring
compressed files. this rate is comparable to that which i get with
slip8250 loaded as a packet driver, and where a single tcp ip session
is active. if cslipper is used a packet driver and a single session
is active, i get transfer rates of 1.3 - 1.4 kb sec on the same
files.
while there is about 40 degradation in the performance of slipper,
for me the benefits of being able to use pktmux outweigh the
performance hit.
c slipper and ethernet simulation mode
in ethernet simulation mode, c slipper ver 1.3 works with all the
applications that i have tested it with. one or two applications
that required ethernet simulation balked at c slipper 1.2, but even
these rare problems have been resolved with ver 1.3
when slipper is used in ethernet simulation mode, and used with pktmux,
i get some an error message in the qvtnet console window that reads
""ip:incorrect packet type"" or ""ip:bad version number"". this does not
seem to prevent qvtnet from functioning, although i cannot comment on
loss of performance.
what can you do if your dos tcp ip application does not work with
c slipper in ethernet simulation mode?
in the rare event that you find a package that does not work with
c slipper in ethernet simulation mode, first contact the author --
peter tattam -- and let him
know. chances are that he can fix it.
in the meanwhile, you can try the following. i do not know if it is
kosher, but it worked when i had problems with c slipper ver 1.2
(c slipper is loaded at 0x62 as described above under the pktmux section)
i load ethersl.com at 0x60, run the application and then terminate
ethersl.com
this also works within windows 3.1 virtual dos boxes. however a
packet driver like ethersl can be used in only one virtual dos box
at a time.
so for example, here is my batch file to run grateful med (a
medical reference retrieval program developed at the national library
of medicine).
ethersl -w 0x60 -h 4 0x03f8 57600 loads etherslip
cd gm6
search
cd termin 0x60 terminates etherslip
exit closes the dos box and returns me to windows
if you use this method, be cautious about one thing -- don't have
any active pktmux dos sessions open at the same time. after closing
the ethersl window, you can run your pktmux dos sessions with no
problem. btw, the example above -- grateful med, works with no
problems with c slipper ver 1.3
phone script files:
the documentation that accompany phone, provide good instructions on
writing script files to get phone to dial slip servers other than
the university of minnesota server. for example here is a script
that i use to dial a cisco server at the university that i attend.
background: to start a slip connection, i dial our terminal server,
and login with a username and password. after doing so, i start a slip
session with the following command ""slip username-slip.dialin.cwru.edu"",
followed by my password -- again.

10034.eml,comp.os.ms-windows.misc,"about a week and one-half ago i posted a query looking for people feelings
on the inkjet family of printers. specifically, a comparison between the
canon bj200 (bubblejet) and the hewlett-packard deskjet 500. many people
asked me to post the summary account of all the postings and e-mail i
received. below is my original query and the responses i received. i have
not deleted any part of the responses, only the headers and signatures, so
you can extract what you find necessary. some people asked me for an
unbiased account; however, the very nature of the question suggests
favoritism and biased comments, you must extract the information you
believe unbiased and a fair representation of each printer. there are a
wide range of comments, each has its own value.
there was no clear winner, some like the bj200 (especially its
price performance ratio), others preferred the durability and reliability
of the deskjet (the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid
background). two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention, a new
printer to be introduced by hewlett-packard later this year (around
summertime), and an addition to the epson product line (their first
inkjet). you will find that after the initial purchase, the costs of
re-filling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same (this largely
depends on where you purchase the re-fills or replacements -- so shop
around first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your
printer). no one mentioned approx. how many sheets each ink cartridge will
print, but i suspect they are roughly equal at about 1000 - 1500 sheets
(laser printers will do 4000-5000 sheets per toner cartridge). well,
that's a brief research summary of my personal research. enjoy! well i bought the bj 200 about a month ago at the start of their 50 rebate
program on that printer (it ends 5 31), and i bought it from computer
discount warehouse because their price of 325 couldn't be beat anywhere i
looked, and i think it's a hot printer. just using regular copier paper
produced fantastic results just in high quality mode. i compared the
output of a micrografx designer legal size drawing with 4pt type done on my
bj 200 with the same drawing printed on an hp laserjet iid and i was amazed
how well i could read the small print on the bj 200. printing speed was
several seconds faster on the bj 200 which is amazing considering that the
hp has 2.5m ram installed. i measured the time from when the printer first
indicated it was receiving data (as i used print manager in windows).
i showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought one
immediately for his office, and two other engineers placed their orders
too. if you need cdw's phone number, it's 800-598-4239. delivery to ny
was two days.
good luck!
craig witkowski, motorola communications electronics inc.
glen rock, nj i own a deskjet 500. performance isn't spectacular under windows using
truetype fonts but neither is the canon from what i have seen. quality for
the hp is very much dependent on paper quality - on 'standard' photo-copy
paper the characters have slightly 'frayed' edges but on better quality
'distinction' type paper things look better. for most applications i find
copy paper fine - still better than dot-matrix. comes with a windows
driver, which seems to by-pass print manager, has a few
'intelli-fonts'which are hp scaleable fonts - probably faster than truetype
but haven't really tried them out. can get ram font cartridges but unless
the speed of truetype is a problem i wouldn't bother. the ram cartridges
can't be used as buffer - soft fonts only.
for graphics, i.e. bmp images etc the hp can be put into a dither mode via
the hp supplied win driver. there a number of dither options such as
'scatter', 'pattern' etc. the manual gives recommendations depending on
the type of image being printed. text is not so good in this mode. problem
arises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text. the
range of tones for graphic images isn't brilliant but i think that is more
of a limitation with inkjet printers in general.
however, a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from
epson. this printer is faster, cheaper, and capable of producing
laser-like quality on normal copier paper. can't remember the model , lx
- something i think?
i purchased my hp days before the epson was released here :- . the
introductory price on the epson was the same as the hp here in new zealand. about a month ago, i got a canon bj200. i absolutely love it. it is
incredibly fast, except for printing from pspice (i don't know if you ever
do stuff with that or not.) most of the stuff i print is either from
microsoft word for windows or just plain text. the only problems i've had
are printing headers footers (the printer freaked out), and printing on
cheap paper (lots of streaks). normal copy paper works great with it, you
can only tell it's not laser-printed by holding it, oh, less than twelve
inches from your face. (that is, if you're nearsighted, like me! :) ) the
printer comes with its own driver for windows 3.1!! i have no other
complaints. the printer also can act just like some epson or another for
those archaic software packages that haven't written a driver for it yet.
the teeny-weeny footprint is a real plus, too--and, if you purchase it
between now and may 31, you get a 50 rebate from canon!! i bought mine
from a store called compusa, and the price now is 340. i have a friend
who has the hp you are looking at. it also prints very well, and everyone
has drivers for it, but it is very slow!
hope i helped!
(360dpi sure looks great!)
heather stehman i guess i have some experience with both: i have a bj-300 at work and a
deskjet 500 at home. i prefer the deskjet. the printing speed and quality
are similar (i tested both with text and graphics before buying the deskjet
for home). the feature that sets the deskjet apart is the driver support
in so many applications. the bj ends up emulating the epson lq or ibm
proprinter to get it to work with many non-windows apps and this will be
the case for a long time. the design is superior if you just want to use
cut paper, the deskjet is quieter, and the ink cartridges are quite a bit
cheaper due to the number of deskjets out there in comparision to the bjs.
just my 0.02 worth..

luling, la 70070
internet address: yes, there is the landscape mode printing problem, but it does not
present a problem in windows as the windows printer driver handles the
translation. i actually thought of some other points after i posted the
note. the deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately .5inch around
the paper the bubblejet does not. you are right about the graphics
resolutions, i tested the printers with the applications i had access to:
wordperfect, harvard graphics, wingif, paintshop pro, and paintbrush and
could not tell a difference. in fact one of the hp deskjet windows drivers
gives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer
hence controlling the amount of ink you put down. the bubblejet did not.
i had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had no
comparision there. finally, i wanted sheet feeding. in that configuration
the bubblejet cost approximately 100 more than the deskjet.
i went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the deskjet when i
spent my own money. btw, i am replacing the bj-300 with a deskjet 500 at
work this month anyway.

ag group of monsanto
luling, la i spent some time comparing the two. we ended up getting the bubblejet
bj-200 versus the hp. our reasons were:
1) the hp seemed to have worse banding than the canon
2) 360dpi versus 300 - we felt we could see the difference
3) price - canon has a 50 rebate program going on at the moment.
the bj-200 was our choice over the bj-10ex - we could have 100 pages in the
bj-200 feeder. the bj-10ex holds only 30 pages, i think.
as you can see, up to 100 pages on the bj-200. we haven't done anything
big with the bj, but its performance seems reasonable under windows. i
know that the microsoft bbs has a newer windows driver than comes with the
printer, but i don't know how it compares (also the driver included with
the printer is canon's whereas i don't know where the microsoft bbs one
comes from - microsoft?)
hope this helps.
thomas v. frauenhofer, wa2yyw ...!uunet!uupsi!cci632!tvf, mandlebratwurst: the meal that eats itself! altough i'm sometimes also a salesperson (if i'm not suppost to study :-))
i would recommend to buy the bj200. the printing quality is a bit better,
but you you've got much more possiblities. don't forget the hp engine is at
least 2 years on the marked, the canon engine (witch is also used in
other ""new"" bubblejet printers like e.g. the epson ones) is quite recently
available..
i've seen during a short demonstration (from someone who tryed to sell me
canon printers) 2 times the same picture, one printed with the bj200, one
with the canon, the other with the hp, and.. there was a difference in
printing- quality,.. the canon was a bit better..
greetz,
kris when we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked to
inkjet printers. they have near laser quality, speed, and they are quiet.
we use both hp deskjets and the canon bj-200s. i prefer the paper handling
qualities of the deskjets but i feel the canons have superior print
quality. the ideal would be a canon with a sheet feeder, however i did end
up buying a deskjet for home use (got too good a deal). anyway, we are
using canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well. out
of 15 deskjets and 4 bj-200s i have only had one problem with a deskjet and
that was taken care of very quickly by hp.
-nate whenever i buy anything i look at what the ""experts"" say, pick out the top
few and then buy on whatever criteria are the most apt. i've been
unusually flush lately (no begging letter please) and so i've done this a
few times including - about four months ago - with inkjet printers.
i can't remember much about the process except that i read about three
reviews of inkjets and that the 500 was always at or near the top. i
bought the 500c because of the added dimension of colour (i intend to build
a multi- media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner
towards that). although i haven's used the colour thing in earnest yet i
tried it out on a couple of windows bitmaps and i was pleased with the
result.
i note that even though you can now get the 550c (the one with both colour
and mono with no need to change the cartridge), the 500c and 500 are still
readily available (at least in the uk). the following are my
views experience:
1.	i don't know anything about the canon except that i came away
from reviews (and replies to a posting similar to yours) with
the idea that the hp offered the best performance price ratio.
2.	i believe hp are the originals in the field - not always the
ideal place to be but the market's still young so one assumes
they have the expertise.
3.	the 500c is worth the extra. operation in mono is perfectly
acceptable and i get good crisp reproduction of fonts from
windows.
4.	i used to work for monotype when they still manufactured
typesetters (before their american owners closed them down!)
and i can tell you that in terms of definition 300 dpi is
pretty poor anyway so 360 dpi is just a bit less poor...
5.	the hp comes with a reasonable set of drivers.
6.	if you buy it invest in the additional ram pack - it's pretty
slow with it, god knows what it's like without!
i actually work in germany and my pc is home in the uk so it's not in daily
use. i would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and
having a really dumb problem at the start it's easy peasy to operate.
hope this is of use.
regards
david just bought the bj-200. i thought the price couldn't be beat ( 329, with 50 rebate thru 5 31) and so far it is comparable, even superior, to the
deskjet in print quality.
speed: per page rate seems to be faster (i don't have figures).
i don't print long docs, though.
quality: i think the graphics quality is excellent. print quality is
excellent as well, unless you use small fonts and hold it up
close; you can see a lot more ""jaggies"" than on a laserjet.
the 360 dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the
page print head in place, i would imagine.
large docs: not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages ...
manual says up to 100, though. haven't tried it.
drivers: no problems under win3.1 yet. winword doesn't want to print
the envelopes the same way the canon does, though.
know nothing of add-on costs.
daniel a. hartung -- -- ask me about rotaract i just bought a bj-200 printer a couple of days ago. i compared it to the
sample print of an hp deskjet 500 and knew that the hp wasn't for me. the
bj-200 is pretty fast and really prints with good quality. i can compare
it with the hp laserjet iiid postscript and they look almost identical (
depending on the kind of paper). i don't have problems with the ink not
being dry, it seems to dry very fast. probably within a second. since
canon is giving a 50 rebate until the end of may, it is really a good buy.

college of fine arts and communications wow, it's funny you should ask this. i'm a little behind in news reading
so i know this may be late.
i just purchased the canon bubblejet last night. i was really worried
that i wouldn't like it but the print quality, and noise level is
fantastic! i printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and it
printed damn near laser quality. you can't tell it's not laser unless you
get 2 inches from the page.
no problems with drivers. the printer came with the driver diskette
which is good because i was beginning to panic when i couldn't findi it
under windows or wordperfect. it works well under both. i have yet to
install word for windows so don't know how it works with them.
i had a deskjet 500 at work last year. it was a good printer as well ut
i felt it was awfully slow. and much noisier than the bubblejet. i won't
say the bubblejet is much better, but i really do like it more. just my 0.02 worth.

(shareware from cica; desktop, i think, filename psvvv.zip (i think,
where vvv is the ver. number. if that's not true, let me know and i""ll
post a corection).
this, however, will write your .rle file with a .bmp extension, so you
have to rename it.
now, another thing....
this is from the windows' faq:
your file has to be less than 64 k
( at least that's what the faq says, but mine wont work for more than
about 30...maybe they mend 32k, i don't know).
your file has to fit vga size (480 860, or whatever standard vga size
is.) if you use a non-vga screen (e.g. cga, ega, svga, there is also a
way to do it, but i thing instead of vgalogo.lgo you use another file,
such as cgalogo.lgo, egalogo.lgo, or something. i'm not sure about
this, as i have a vga, but i'm sure you could find it in the faq (a
windows help ver. of which is available at cica, but don't konw the
filename).
also....your .bmp has to be 16 colours or less.
these specs rule out some of the good .bmp's. i found cartoon drawings
work quite well as they have the advantage of looking good with little
memory.
finally, remember to save your current win.com before, and put your
new win.com in the windows directory. also, don't start windows from a
directory where another win.com is present, as that is used instead of
the one in the windows dir, and win. won't start.
share this fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie (pf).

it's the latest, as this is not long ago), and i was initially imressed.
but here's the low-down:
winzip is a great progra, as long as you only unzip . it lets you
vew files, unzip only selected files, and even puts the files in a checkout directory, and creates a ""checkout"" .grp and group if you want
to check the program out. it even prompts for deletion of these on
exit, if you didn;t like the program. however (big however over here). i have problems zipping. i don't
konw specifics on this, or ammount of consistency, but sometimes when i
""zip"" a few files, or add a file to a .zip, dos will violate something
or other, and i'll be asked (in a kind, micro oft kind of way) to quit
all applications, quit windows, and restart my computer. i don't know
(as i said) how consistent this is, as i jdont' zip much (and when i do,
now i just go to dos and use it from there, or just use the ""run"" cmd)
but i do know it's happened when i added files to an existing .zip
file, and when i created a new .zip file, using selected files only.
i don't know if it's happened when i zip an entire dir.
still, it has a rather nice interface, and quite useful ""unzip""ing
functions. if the above is fixed, i'll be the first to register the new
ver. (as for now, a good old, ""run-- unzip .zip"" will work.

1. what software is the culprit? win 3.1, ndw, my applications? are
some modes of win 3.1 (standard, real, enhanced) better than others at
plugging this leak?
2. are their system.ini switches i can set to help plug this leak?
3. do people know of patches or third party software that help with

great market for a third party memory company like qemm.
4. if i run progman instead of ndw will the leak subside? (i was
hoping that ndw 2.2 would have plugged this, but it seems no different
than 2.0 in how it deals with memory and resources.)

10074.eml,comp.os.ms-windows.misc,"i just got off the phone with ms access support and was told that they
(microsoft) has decided to implement, as a standard for software support,
the local setup (described below) as the ""most advantageous installation"".
if this is true and microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installation
then i will comply but i'd like to hear it from administrators first.
the local windows installation: windows is fully installed on each workstation hard drive (assuming the
resources are available). from a network administrator's implementation,
he she would install all windows disks on a network drive using setup a.
then install windows on a per machine bases by running setup off the network
to install the complete system on the local drives. in this way, all drivers
are available to the setup procedure w o the need to change disks.
advantages:
- reduce traffic - running windows locally reduces network traffic due to
the local access of main windows files.
- network independence - if the network fails (and they all do at one point
or another), the local installation would allow users to keep producing
and reduce the cost of down-time.
- faster windows - theoretically, windows will run faster from a local hard
drive than over a network. this may be a hard point to prove if the network
has an optical backbone and or the network drives are significantly faster
access than local ones.
- a user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about
varying setups (monochrome, color, types of mouse, etc...) since the
windows installation is assigned to the workstation.
disadvantages:
- cost - installing windows locally requires a significant amount of disk
space. workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can
increase the cost of the workstation from 10 to 30 percent.
- administration - local windows installations are very difficult to
administer.
new drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available, each of
which would have to be individually installed on each workstation.
- security - users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system
files from simple ignorance. this could result in quite a headache for
administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations.
- backup - we all know the problems backing up local hard disks. the backup
sets (if done via a centralized tape system) get very large very quickly.
backup individually (to floppy) may not happen at all. this may be
eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable
applications and not user data.
the shared windows installation windows is fully installed to a network disk via the setup a procedure
described above. users (or administrators) then install a minimal set of
files to individual ""user"" directories. these directories may be on a
local hard disk or perhaps a network ""home"" directory. the bulk of the
windows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory
(some 400 files) and are accessed (shared) as-needed by users throughout
their windows session. the user's files consist of a small set of files
that the user has updated during his her windows session. these include
group files, .ini files and other regularly updated files.
advantages:
- a single location for all files makes updates to drives easy. as
an updated driver becomes available, it only needs to be installed in this
single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it.
- assuming that the users' files are maintained in network (home) directories,
the administrator can easily edit any .ini file as-needed to correct
problems that may arise. this includes win.ini and system.ini.
- backup of all pertinent files is done easily. even if the users' files
are on a local hard disk, the bulk of the windows system is backed up with
all driver updates.
disadvantages:
- network traffic - since all windows files are being shared in a network
directory, traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the
speed of windows.
- if the network crashes, all production comes to a stop since window's
is reliant upon the network for its files. loss of data usually occurs
as well since users working in windows at the time of the crash will
usually not be able to save their work.
- although minimal, disk space is still a consideration. if the users' files
are maintained on the network, a large number of users can cause a
significant utilization of disk space due to their personal windows
files alone.
- users cannot easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation
hardware are similar. this is due to the windows installation being
tied to a particular username (in the case of network user files).
the discussion i would like to know, from other administrators with a large windows
userbase, how they prefer setting up windows. personally, i have
setup numerous installations using the shared setup. all windows and
application files are on the network with little or no utilization of
local hard disks. in fact, i sold a network on the fact that the
company would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations
and thus save that much more money.
i would also like to see recommendations for applications. should
apps such as word and or excel be installed locally regardless of how
windows is installed? again, i keep all files on the network for easy
backup and administration but this is ""putting all eggs in one basket"";
if the network crashes, work comes to a halt.
now i am sure microsoft (and i know your out there) has their own
ideas about this and their insights would be of great value but i hope to
hear from people with ""actual"" working experience with users and network
administration."

10078.eml,comp.os.ms-windows.misc,"context: i use a package called slip on my home computer to connect to the
university mainframe (an ibm 3090 running vms mvs), and log on to my
account. when i installed slip on my computer, i had to configure it
for my modem (14.4 kbs etronics internal) and had to supply the phone
number to dial to reach the mainframe. the way it works now is that
i type ""telnet uicvm"" or ""tn3270 uicvm"" (either will work) at the dos
prompt. uicvm is the node name of the mainframe. the program then
dials the mainframe, establishes a protocol, and gives me the logon
screen. ""telnet"" and ""tn3270"" are the names of batch files in my slip
directory. i have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the
session.
problem: i would like to be able to do all this under windows 3.1 because i
hardly ever use dos directly. slip will not run under windows. i
talked to the people at our computer center, and they suggested that
i use a packet driver called winpkt.com with slip. they gave me
instructions on how to load it before i start windows, and how to
modify the tcpstart and tcpstop batch files (in the slip directory)
to ensure that it would work. i did all that and i could run slip
from windows, but there were other problems. for one thing, slip
would not hang up the phone when i exited. i had to run my communi-
cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when
that didn't work. for another, there were too many errors. it often
took me 3-4 tries to connect to the mainframe. our computer center
does not support slip under windows, so i can't keep going back to
them with more questions.
question: is there some other shareware package that will run under windows
and do what slip is supposed to do? i need a package that is not too
expensive, which is why i am looking for shareware. i have heard that
there are regular commercial packages that do all this, but they cost
hundreds of dollars. these are the main requirements:
1. must be able to run under windows 3.1
2. must allow vt100 and ibm tn3270 terminal emulation
3. must allow ftp file transfers, since that's the only kind the
mainframe allows. no y-modem or z-modem etc. i believe the ftp
transfers are made through a kermit protocol, but i'm hazy about
that.
a subsidiary feature (that would be nice to have) if it's a true
windows program (rather than a dos program modified to run under
windows) is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently
with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet
session and other applications.
any information received is appreciated.

now here's the kicker:
i have many windows open while doing this; both dos and windows apps.
supposedly all windows' apps share the same time slice, whereas the
dos apps get their own equal time slice (unless overriden).
so, as an example, i have 5 windows' apps open, 2 multitasking dos sessions running,
and one execution-execlusive dos shell iconized (inactive). under this
scenario, cpu time is divided into two major slices: one for all the windows
apps and one slice for the running dos app.
when copying under windows pgm mgr, i'll assume the other windows and dos tasks
are essentially inactive. thus pgm mgr gets, say, 80 of the windows slice and
95 of the execution-background dos shell's slices. thus it gets (.8)(.95) 2 .72 or 72 of the total available cpu time.
when copying in a dos shell, i activate the execute-exclusive mode dos shell
(no other dos background tasks allowed), full screen, under the windows task
manager. the cpu time available to this shell would be 80 of the windows slice
(assumming inactive windows applications) and 100 of the dos slice:
(1.0)(.8) .8 or 80 of the total available cpu time.
so why do i get copy errors under dos if it has the greater amount of cpu
time? is program manager working in a pre-emptive mode during the floppy
copy? it must be!

happened - i got a direct lightning strike on my house - and to the second
floor outlet box into which my faithful deskjet 500c was connected. there
was a .303-bullet-sized hole in the aluminum siding with some solidified
aluminum slag dripping from it. you could actually see the electrical box
through the hole! the outlet itself was fried and i'm still amazed the
whole damn house didn't burn down.
i lost 2 electric garage door openers, 2 vcr's, 2 telephones (all of which
were on the opposite side of the house), a zyxel u-1496e high speed modem,
a vga monitor, a 1024x768 color monitor, the rs232 and parallel ports on my

but, the deskjet ran as soon as i found a functioning serial and parallel
port to connect to it.

i don't know how the rest of you read news, but here's how i do it: i
subscribe to an ""outernet"" system which allows me to dial up via modem and
download e-mail and news articles automatically. when someone posts a
huge attached binary file, i have no choice but to receive it along with
all the other new articles in the groups i subscribe to. i also pay for
the connect time, which is normally not a problem because i have a 14.4k
modem and each day's upload download session takes only 5 minutes or so.
today's session, however, lasted about 25 minutes because of roman.bmp.
consequently, it cost me about 3.00 extra just to receive a file that i
didn't want in the first place.
if you have cool bitmaps that you want to make available, there are other
ways to do it: either upload the file to an ftp site (like
ftp.cica.indiana.edu, which has a complete windows section) and tell
people how to get to it, or use one of the newsgroups like
alt.binaries.pictures (or something like that), which are file archives
rather than discussion groups. don't use discussion groups like this one
to send out attached files, especially when they're 600k in size.

10135.eml,comp.os.ms-windows.misc,"there are a few things to consider before you make the leap though.
first (for me at least) is that you cannot get a full-speed dos box.
what i mean is, i cannot (for instance) run falcon 3.0 or any other
resourse intensive program in a dos box. it absolutley crawls.
and my machine is a 486 33 with a 330mb hd and 16mb ram. if anyone
knows how to get a fast dos box (or full-screen for that matter),
please let me know.
the second thing is there are still not many drivers around for stuff.
for instance, my pas-16 has been demoted to running as a sound blaster
(which is natively supported -- nice), because mediavision hasn't
produced drivers yet.
your disk should be large enough to keep an 80mb dos partition, and
give the rest over to windows nt (tm). the only thing is, whenever
you wanted to run windows programs, you'd have to reboot and log into
windows nt (tm), instead of just typing win.
windows nt (tm) does seem to be much more stable than normal windows
though. it'd be a good choice if you have the resources. you should
really have at least 8mb ram though. one last thing, modems work
well enough, but i have yet to get my fax card to work, and i've never
heard of anyone else who did either.
it's only better than unix because it runs killer software out of the
box, whereas with unix there isn't the same availablity.
i guess it comes down to -- windows nt (tm) is not yet for the faint
of heart, it's still a beta. but it's a very good beta.

10142.eml,comp.os.ms-windows.misc,"i would expect the eisa board to be more than twice as fast as the isa
board. not only are you moving data on a path twice as wide (at
least), but there is a difference in the number of clocks required for
bus transactions between the two busses. most isa boards require
multiple clocks per bus transaction -- typically this is around 3-4.
eisa boards are suppose to be able to 'burst' at a 1:1 rate, so i
would expect performance to be 6x-8x that of an isa card.
so i guess, for me, the question is unanswered still. i would expect
him to be able to see a 6x speed difference, and he apparently does
not.

my question: how do i print this postscript file through the print

manager, it treats the postscript as a text file, and gives me
several pages of postscript gibberish.
i know that i can open a dos window and do:
copy file.ps com1:
which does work, but seems not to multitask very well -- other applications
run rather slowly and often pause for 10's of seconds.
there ought to be a way of passing the postscript file to the print

well, if it is one of those that comes with windows, just highlight the

you should see a box which says 'change icon'. click on it. you are going
to be presented with some icons (sometimes just one). if you don't like
any of those presented, click on the 'browse' box, and look for the file
'moricons.dll' select it. browse through the icons presented, and just
double click on your desired icon.
if you want to replace it with an icon from some other icon manager,
say iconpower for instance, open the icon manager at the bottom of your

when you have found your desired icon, click on it once, and while holding

it's not a two way street. the other machine is the server and this

ah, finally a question i can answer. i mess with this older
stuff alot. kinda fun. 8)
first problem i can forsee is that the st-251 will not be
compadible with that wd card unless it has the right bios rom.
check the numbers on it. it should be the only non-smt chip on
the board. slightly below center, and left. the bios should read
either : 62-000042-015 or
62-000094-0x2
if the last 3 digits are 013, you got problems.
looks right. w5 and w7 are factory jumped (with a trace) between
pins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address.
looks right. art deleted i notice you left out the s1 jumper table settings. those are
what control what drive the controller thinks it has. if you have
the 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:
5 open
6 open
7 open
8 open
4 closed
3 closed
2 open
1 open
note: those are how wd runs the numbers on the jumper block.
top to bottom. 's represent the jumper pins. pins 3,4, and 8
select the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the
second drive (drive 1).
if you have the 62-000094 rom, it's a auto-config, and i'll have
to look up how to do it... i don't have the big book right here.
see above. you might have problems if the s1 jumpers are not
right. also, at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables
are on right and good. 8). on the jumper on the 251, try moving it
to the opposite side of the drive. it's one or the other.
the narrow data cable goes to j2. i've thrown it on j3 a few
times and banged my head for a day.....
dunno. ibm roms had to be later than 10 27 82. a quick way
to check is to boot dos and run debug. enter:
-d f000:fff5 fffc (the - is the debug prompt)
this will return the rom date, if it's of any use.
if i oversimplified any of the above, i appologize. it's
just hard to know what caliber of person i'm talking to. 8).

if you are using a twisted 34-way cable then move the jumper
on your drive to the neighbouring pins :8::::::. make sure that
the twisted cable is for a hard disk (and not a floppy disk) - the
coloured stripe (pin 1) should be furthest from the twist.
this may also help.

note 2: tandy 1000 systems - the wd1002a-wx1, wd1004a-wx1,
wdxt-gen2 and the wd1004-27x can be modified to operate in
tandy 1000 series computers, models sx, tx and the original or
""a"" version. these computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (irq2)
instead of irq5, the ibm standard. to modify the wd1002a-wx1 or
the wd1002-27x to operate in these systems, you must cut the
etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position w-7. then
solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (w-7). to complete the
modification, a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch s-1
(2 rows of 8 pins). please note that any physical modification
to your western digital hard disk controller voids the warranty
on your board. to modify the wd1004a-wx1, wdxt-gen2 or the
wd1004-27x for your tandy 1000 system, a zero ohm resister must
be soldered to jumper position w-27. this will change the
interrupt from irq5 to irq2.

from sony about these formats and mentioned this to get the reply ""md

pressed for info about mo the sony man basically admitted that it was
no more than a slight adaptabtion on md!
what i think the original poster was wanting was mo drives at md audio

only to be told that there's nothing wrong with it. i
checked the other post in this group about maxtor, and
i don't seem to be the only one who has problems. however,
no one describes the same problem, and i also have a
different configuration.
thanx in advance for any e-mailed help.

58914.eml,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,"andrew, yes there is a dx and dx2 version of the 50mhz 486. if you are
considering buying one or the other, definitely go for the dx with a nice
size external cache! the performance is far greater.
the dx2 only has the internal 8k cache to work with at 50mhz, while the dx
has a potentially much larger cache to work at 50mhz with. neither
systems could actually run a program out of main memory, since dram is
still too slow for that high of bus speed ( 60ns 16.66mhz 50mhz ).

58915.eml,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,"don't believe everything you are told. i can tell you that mixing them
between 'banks' ok, and i can't see why mixing in one bank is not unless
they are of different speeds ( e.g. mixing of 60ns and 100ns simms in one
bank ). the two only differ in the type of chips it uses. assuming that
the simms are 1mx9 ( 9 bit wide ), here is the two equivalent
configuration. the 3-chip simm uses two 4-bit wide 4mbit (1m of 4-bit
nibbles ) and one 1-bit wide 1mbit chip ( for a total of 9-bit wide 1mbyte
). the 9-bit simm uses nine 1-bit wide 1mbit chips. these are equivalent
because of the way that it is 'pinned' on the simm board. at the simm
interface, they both act as 9-bit wide 1mbyte simms ( 2 4 1 9 1 ). sorry
if too techie for ya .
mg similarly, one cannot plug in two 1mb simms and one 4mb simms to
gi
mg the system a total of 6 meg. why is that so ?? if my system supports
mg of 8 meg (it has 8 simm slots), can i plug in 4 4mb simms to give my
mg 16mb ??
that sounds correct. the problem is that if your computer takes 9-bit
wide simms, you can not mix different sizes in one bank. why you ask?
simple, if you understand why there is banks. assuming you have a 32-bit
cpu ( 386dx or 486 ), the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data
from memory ) is 32-bits wide, so the computer expects to see 32 bits when
it asks for data. to get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ), the motherboard
links 4 1mx9 ( one bit is not data, but parity, so i will ignore that in
this simple explaination ) to get 32bits (9-1) 4 32 bits . that means
that a simm in a bank stores only 1 4 of the 32 bit wide data. if you
have a 16-bit bus, two 1mx9 simms are linked together to get 16-bit wide
data, which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 simms wide, and 32-bit banks
are 4 simms wide. if your computer required 1mx36 ( e.g. 32-bit wide data
with 4 parity bits, used in some ps 2s and asts ), you could upgrade by
one simm at a time.
hope that this message is not over your head, but the answer to your
question was not simple. i could of just said, 'because i said so.'

58981.eml,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,"these questions can be answered by any dealer of ibm value points, but, i will
provide some unsolicited advice -- the most amusing kind of advice.
today (tueday 4-6-93) ibm is supposed to officially announce the introduction
of the vesa local bus value point systems. these systems still have on-board
video and disk which are far better than the prior value point systems, and
you get vesa local bus for (future?) upgrades. we are going to buy three of
them with 17"" monitors (also a newly available), and one of the three will
immediately be upgraded to ultrastor 34f caching scsi disk controller and
either the ati gup or the viper graphics board.
do not buy a 486sx sytem.
my personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss-free. when

one of my pc illiterate friends asked me to help him install drdos 6.0 on his

unfortunately, the drdos refuses to recognize the hard drive during
installation, even though i am still able to boot off of the hard drive using
the old dos. after openning it up i discovered it was using an 8-bit
seagate scsi controller on a st-157n scsi 40mbtye drive. i then booted
with drdos 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if
i could access the drive. lo and behold the primary 46.5 mbyte partition
was intact (created by dos 3.1 no less, i didn't think you could go over a
32mbyte partition in the older doses. i could be wrong...). i then tried
to remove the primary partition, which it wouldn't allow me to do. i am

1) get a 386dx-40 387dx-40 or
2) get some sort of 486.
unfortunately i live in the uk where computer prices are far too high.
the first option works out at about pounds 200. 486 m boards start at
this price for a sx-25.
i have a couple of questions.
1) how much of an improvement in speed should i notice if i get a
386dx copro. remember i'm using a 32 bit os, and alot of floating point
operations.
2) how much faster would a 486dx-33 be than the 386dx-40 copro ?
should i get an upgradeable m board with a 386dx-40 and wait for

i started off with a newly installed win31 and then installed excel.
run excel, no problem. a permanent swap file of size 18k was in place
for windows.
ok, i then proceed to install norton desktop
for windows version 2.0. no problem with the installation. i also
allow ndw to alter my autoexec.bat(with the nav running on c:).
the problem came when i try to (bring up excel or if excel is running
and right in the middle of it - like click a selection with the mouse)
from the desktop.
first of all, i always get the application error screen followed by
another application error screen with various different messages. the
following are some of them:
- stack fault, by tc1024.drv at address 0001:xxxx where xxxx is some
number. (tc1024.drv is the vga driver provided by the manufacture)
- general protection fault, by ndw.exe at the same address
- segment load failure, by ndw.exe at same address
some how, the address flagged was always 0001:something. what is address
0001:xxxx means?
i have absolutely on idea what this mean. i tried commented out the
tsr programs from autoexec.bat, no help.
is it something to do with the emm386 setup which is not telling
win31 what it suppose to know. looks like the application is crossing
memory boundary when it is being loaded or while it is running.

59000.eml,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,"your machine will run at whatever the bus is jumpered to cmos is set to
(usually wait states) regardless of what speed ram is installed. no
motherboard can sense the speed of the ram installed, unless you call
failing as a sort of auto-sense. this is how you can sometimes use
""slower"" ram in a machine. you either set the number of wait states to
accomodate the slow ram (in which case, all memory will run at that
slower rate) or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the
slower ram will act like faster ram and you won't crash.
putting faster ram in won't speed things up unless you tell the machine
it has faster ram.
mixing fast and slow ram will not help you if you have to keep the bus
slowed down to accomodate slow ram.

59001.eml,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,"does it do it to all tapes? were the two tapes that it unwound of the same
type from the same batch? the reason i ask is that i bought some generic tapes
that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and
had closed the little marker hole. it was only on a few tapes of a set.
did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels?
if you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of
the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.
as you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more
than you have to. as you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in
the tape. these are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is
at the end of the tape. the holes are spaced a couple of inches apart. my best
guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second
marker?
anyhow, if the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tape
is clean. the function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes. the
tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where
the reflection would come out. when the hole goes by, the pickup detects the
light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop. if the mirror is dirty
or out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have
a problem detecting the end of the tape.
if the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then either
the pickup or the led of the sensor system has failed or is dirty. if you open
the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the r w head
assembly. if it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive may
need to be serviced. it is possible that the led is burned out or the sensor
is out.
if it is still in warranty, you might be able to send it back to cms for
repair.

the through put maximum of ide in asynchronous mode. in full scsi-2 mode
it blows poor ide out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can.
the problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put

the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the

prophisy: few people buy scsi because it is so expencive for the pc, which
in turn convices makes that mass producing scsi which would reduce its
cost is unwarented, and so scsi is expencive. that is the effect of the

going to upgrade both to ms dos v 5.0
the drives themselves are both model number wd95044-a circa 5-07-1991
they are 782 cyl 4 head drives. a note to add is that there is no exact
configuration for these in my current bios, but it seems to work at a
setting 17 (977 cyl 5 head, 300 write pre, 977 landing zone).
there are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that i presume are
for setting up the master slave. originally, the drive in the machine
had none. currently, i was suggested to try the far right (looking at the
back) for master and the middle jumper for the slave.
when booted, the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive. it does
flicker about three times on the second drive, but then gives the error.
hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted, but not
being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive, i
would not even know how to do that.
any and all help on this is great fully appreciated. if not, a number
for western digital might just do as good!

60157.eml,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,"i have recently suffered from various problems concerning
an adaptec 1542a controller.
problem 1:
floppy disk drive doesn't work. there's apparently at least two jumpers
on the controller that affect the floppy disk drive. unfortunately i
have located only one of them (in the lower front corner). i would like
to know, if there are any other such jumpers and possibly where they
are located.
problem 2:
my hard disks refuse to boot. with my two scsi hd's (rodime, miniscribe)
i get a message 'missing operating system', even though the disks have been
formatted with the same controller and they damn sure have an operating
system on them. if i boot from a quantum i might get as far as getting
the ms-dos version information. this might of course be due to incombatible
memory drivers.
are there any jumpers that could affect the hd causing such errors?

60172.eml,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,"introduction:
this is the third (and final) call for votes (cfv) for the creation
of four os 2 newsgroups and the renaming of one:
(a) create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)
(b) renaming of comp.os.os2.programmer to
comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)
(c) comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)
(d) comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)
(e) comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)
this is the second attempt at creating comp.os.os2.programmer.porting
and comp.os.os2.setup, and renaming comp.os.os2.programmer to
comp.os.os2.programmer.misc. the first attempt failed in the summer
of 1992 (the voting deadline was august 31, 1992). the voting rules
state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started
after a six month waiting period (in this case, it is march 1, 1993).
this is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and
comp.os.os2.bugs.
this document contains: the background showing the need for these proposals the proposed charters for these proposals voting instructions a voting ballot some example ballots the voting rules the voting schedule the mass acknowledgement
background:
the creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for os 2 2.x (gcc 2
and emx gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred
a continuing deluge of software ported from unix platforms, such
as emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and
much more. borland has released its c c compiler for os 2 2.x,
allowing for easier porting of dos and windows software.
much of the pc hardware and drivers were written for dos, and
later, windows. as more people are discovering os 2 2.x, the
number of people asking questions about os 2's compatibility
with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the
availability of drivers for their hardware, installation
procedures, etc.
multimedia is becoming popular. os 2 2.0 supports windows
multimedia extensions using win-os 2 3.0. furthermore, ibm is
including direct multimedia support in os 2 starting with version
2.1 (in addition to using win-os 2 3.1).
any non-trivial software will have bugs -- os 2 is not exempt,
especially since ibm is constantly adding new features to os 2.
so far, ibm has issued system patches and corrective service disks
(e.g. the service pak) for free (free from bbss and ftp sites, or
for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read
comp.os.os2.misc for details).
proposed charters:
(a) create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)
it will provide a forum for developers of ported software so
as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and
spur additional development. the group will also cover
topics such as porting from other platforms (such as dos,
windows, unix, etc), toolkits which aid in program
portability (including porting tools such as mirrors), and
so forth.
(b) rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)
to keep the structure of the os 2 newsgroup heirarchy
orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to
comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.
comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup
for os 2 programmers to discuss programming issues and
technical aspects of os 2 in an unmoderated setting.
(c) create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)
it will be devoted to os 2 system setup topics, including the
availability of device drivers, compatibility information,
installation procedures, system requirements, and overall
performance optimization.
(d) create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)
it will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.
(e) create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)
it will provide a forum for os 2 system bug reports, bug
diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system
patches and corrective service disks, and so forth. note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other
newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in os 2 betas belong in
comp.os.os2.beta how to vote:

voting rules: one vote per person. if you vote more than once, only the most
recent vote will be counted. votes must be mailed to me by the person voting. proxy voting,
forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted. do not ask how the votes are going. the status of the votings
will be revealed only after the poll closes. i will acknowledge votes by mass acknowledgement (ack). i will
post the ack twice (see schedule below). if you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how
voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.
also see the how to create a new newsgroup'' article which is
posted to news.answers on a regular basis. if you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this
cfv, send me e-mail at when the voting period is over (see schedule below), a proposal
passes if both of the following formulas are true:
1) the number of yes votes exceeds the number of no votes
by at least 100 (i.e. yes no 100, or yes - no 100).
2) the number of yes votes exceeds at least twice the
number of no votes (i.e. yes 2 no, or yes - no no).
in other words, a proposal passes if:
yes - no max (100, no)
where max() returns the highest number given to it.
schedule:
the voting period started on march 29 when the first cfv was posted
by david lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).
this third cfv is a repeat of the first cfv, but it also has the
mass acknowledgement (ack) of names and e-mail addresses of those who
have already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there. if you
have not voted yet, vote now!
the voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (central time), on
april 24, 1993. votes received after that time will not count.
the voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that
date.

given the original question (scsi used only as a single hard drive

what does a 200-400 meg 5 megs sec scsi drive cost?
the original cga cart back in '84 was 300. i think the original ega card

in price, mainly because we're talking about pc's and not sun's or sparc
or sgi or (name your favorite unix workstation). that is, after millions
of pc buying decisions over the years, scsi has had plenty of time to
come down in price.

just one more mode. geez. had i known, i wouldn't have bothered. i
asked them why, and all i got was ""your point is well taken, but
orchid's software developers are busy with other projects.""
so, to get to the point, finally, are there any s3 86c805

get another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next
generation of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my
system and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're
broken.
if you want these modes, steer away from orchids s3 86c805

a mouse on com2, and the other serial port was set to com3 (which
normally uses the same interrupt as com1). we had a real fight
with a board when trying to use irq5, and discoverd the problem
was that gateway had set it up such that com3 used irq5. as soon

50439.eml,comp.sys.mac.hardware,"if you write a second time to a cd you need to have multi-session capability to
read the second session. whether it is photos or just data or whatever.
here is a simplified way of looking at it:
the first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks. the
second session has a newer directory structure, but the first directory still
exists, because you cannot change, only add. so if you put that in a 'normal'
drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all
data. multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last

often, when i boot up my iisi i get the flashing question mark. sometimes, if i
then insert the silverlining (5.42) program i can get it to recognize the drive
by making it scan over and over for drives. at that point i can restart the
iisi and boot from the hd. i've called la cie again and they've given me
another rma. their tech support people tell me that if silverlining doesn't see
the drive there's a definite hardware problem.
given that this is the second bad drive in four months, i asked la cie to send
me a new one, but they said ""no."" also, within three weeks after i purchased
my original drive, la cie dropped the price on it by over 100.
i can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. and i know that hardware vendors
make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. and
i understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden
price fluctuations. nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these
facts events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (i should have added above that
when i asked la cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one
they will send i think the data is still in good shape and i'll have to again
reinstall everything from floppies they said it would cost me 250 for data
recovery.)
it seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a
discounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still
covered under a 90-day warranty) should be new.
i feel a little helpless about all this. i don't mean to necessarily flame la
cie their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful.
but c'mon. sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (i sent
a letter to la cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and i
asked them for a credit on the price difference since i had purchased the drive
three weeks before they slashed the price. i told them i would like to apply

funny how the iisi running at 25 mhz is slower than other equivalent

makes a difference or the fact that not much ram was allocated.
another interesting thing is how fast the sgi did it. wow.
basically, though, i wouldn't draw any conclusions from this data. it
seems that mathematica's speed is dependant on a lot of variables. i
was just curious how different machines would measure up.

based on some exp. i must say that the connections between the power supply

badly connected due to some corrosion and the powersupply can be in the

so you can do following if you are used to such technical terms.
1) clean all mentioned contacts with contact spray
2) readjust the 5 volt level of your powersupply
3) use a calm fan and think of preventing dust blowin through the floppy!

the following is the apple spec for the lc cpu vga cable adapter. i'm assuming
that the powerbooks duos will work with the same adapter(?);
macintosh lc to vga
the macintosh lc can supply a 640 x 480, vga timed signal for use with vga
monitors by using an adapter cable. the standard macintosh lc supports vga to
16 colors, and with the optional 512k vram simm, the vga monitor is supported
to 256 colors.
note: the macintosh lc supplies signals capable of driving ttl level
inputs. however, some low impedance input vga monitors do not work
with the macintosh lc.
to connect a macintosh lc to a vga monitor, you need to make an adapter cable
from the macintosh lc video connector to the vga monitor. following is the
pinout description for the adapter cable:
macintosh lc vga
video connector pin signal name
1 6 red ground
2 1 red video signal
5 2 green video signal
6 7 green ground
9 3 blue video signal
13 8 blue ground
15 13 hsync
12 14 vsync
14 10 hsync ground
7,10 nc sense1 sense2 tied together
vga monitors are identified by shorting pin 7 to pin 10 on the macintosh lc
video connector. the macintosh lc grounds pin 7 on its video connector, which
results in pulling down pin 10 and gives the correct monitor id for a vga
monitor. this message was created on mcw bbs a jointly supported by

50495.eml,comp.sys.mac.hardware,"i can only comment on thermal recalibration in general. some new
drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data
writes. basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform
a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical
tolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, some track drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. this
becomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and
so was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it
seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of
boosting the drive's long-term reliability and mtbf ratings.
i first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed
out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when
digitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. some manufacturers
explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are not
to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.
hope this helps.

the owners of the board's compression technology. (i'm writing this
from memory; i've lost the reference. please correct me if i'm wrong.)
using the board, i've had problems with file icons being lost, but it's
hard to say whether it's the board's fault or something else; however,
if i decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board,
the icon usually reappears. because of the above mentioned licensing
problem, the freeware expansion utility dd expand will not decompress
a board-compressed file unless you have the board installed.
since stac has its own product now, it seems unlikely that the holes
in autodoubler diskdoubler related to the board will be fixed.
which is sad, and makes me very reluctant to buy stac's product since
they're being so stinky. (but hey, that's competition.)

reports that apple is probably planning a drop in august. my guess
is that it may come sooner if apple decides to change the price
structure upon release of the multimedia units this summer.
your price looks pretty good at about 50 more then i payed for
mine last month. i would have rather waited for one of the new
machines this sommer (like the cyclone) but the resale value of my

bottome line: if the c650 does what you want, buy it. if you wait
until the cylcones come out for a price break then you might as
well wait for the powerpcs to come out for another price break and
then the units which follow them. you may save some money but

supposedly the fast and best now. it has an access of 200ms and a data
transfer rate 300kb sec. it is multisession photo-cd compatible. it is
available from educorp for 599, the cd-technology one, and comes with two
mail in coupons for two free cds. i'm not sure if the cd's are good, since
i've only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cd's shipped
to my home address in california instead of here in maryland. the
cd-technology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive,
which supposedly gives it a longer life, and keeps it cleaner with no fan to
attract dust. a toshiba brand drive is also available, but i think the
cd-technology is better, since you get the same mechanism, and at a slightly
lower price with two free cds.
the apple 300 330i drive, sony mechanism, is around a 300ms access time i
think, and a data transfer rate of 300kb sec. i know it is the slowest of the
three mentioned here. it is not widely available, except through the apple
catalog, which is bad at a price of only 599. it is also multi-session photo
cd compatible. i think the external model comes with 7 free cds, some of
which are pretty good.
the nec drive has been out the longest. it has an access time of 280ms and
a data transfer rate of 300kb sec. it is available from many vendors around 600 dollars, including educorp. it wasn't multi-sesssion photo-cd compatible
before, but i hear that the current version that is shipping is. owners of
the older drives can get an upgrade. it does not come with any free cd's
unless you buy it in a bundle.
of the three cd-rom drives above, i think the best choices would be the
apple drive and the cd-technology(toshiba) drive. the apple drive for it's
compatibility with apple products and the cd-technology(toshiba) for it's
speed and performance.
btw, the models of the drives are:
apple: applecd 300 or applecd 300i (internal)
cd-technology: cd-t3401 (the toshiba brand name model i'm not sure, but it
is also something like with 3401)
nec: cdr-74

50526.eml,comp.sys.mac.hardware,"i have a quadra 950.
i have a nubus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 mb s.
(using block-mode transfers)
i have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous pb calls) that can
achieve 6.8 mb s.
let's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.
it is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer,
then transfer all the data from the buffer to card. (6.8 mb s then 8.5 mb s
result in an overall 3.8 mb s. too slow!)
so i tried the following scheme: for an n-megabyte transfer,
step 1: load the 1st mb from disk to buffer.
step 2: asynch send 1st mb out card, load the 2nd mb from disk to buffer.
step 3: asynch send 2nd mb out card, load the 3rd mb from disk to buffer.
...
step n: asynch send the n-1 mb out card, load the nth mb from disk to buffer.
step n 1: send the nth mb out card.
even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously,
and the card does not use the mac cpu at all, (it is using the buffer, tho')
each of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were
executed one after another. so there is no improvement in the rate.
why?
is the mac ram dual-port? (so the nubus card and the disk driver can both
access data at the same time.)
is the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use
the same bus to mac ram?
is there anything i can do? --------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------"
50527.eml,comp.sys.mac.hardware,"""why would apple release a duo dock with a processor of its own?""
here's why- people have hounded apple for a notebook with a 68040 processor
in it. apple can't deliver that right now because the 040 saps too much
power, radiates far too much heat, and is too large for a notebook. how
does one get around that without designing a new chipset? use existing
powerbook technology to your best advantage. the duo dock gives apple a
unique ability to give users that 040 power in a ""semi-portable"" fashion.
by plunking the 040 into the dock, you've got ""quadra"" power at your desk.
on the road, that 33mhz 68030 should be able to handle most of your needs.
okay, not the best solution, but its an answer to a no-win situation. :-)
so, does this mean one will be able to use the powerbook's processor in
parallel to the dock's processor? okay, we're getting really hypothetical
now...

monitor:	apple 16""
when the computer is set for 256 colors and certain operations are done,
particularly vertical scrolling through a window, horizontal white lines
appear on the monitor (which generally but not always spare open
windows). these lines accummulate as the operation is continued. if a
window is moved over the involved area of the screen and then moved away
the line disappear from that area of the screen. this problem is not
observed if the monitor is configured for 16 colors or a 14 inch apple
monitor with 256 colors is used.
i suspect a bad video ram chip but cannot be certain. the problem has
been apparent since day 1 but has gotten worse.
we were wondering if anyone has seen anything like this, and if so, how
to fix it. please also respond to thank you
for your help.

x
xabout this file:
x
x this file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to
x the international obfuscated c code contest (ioccc for short).
x
x this is not the ioccc rules, though it does contain comments about
x them. the guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.
x entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are
x allowed. even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.
x
x you should read the current ioccc rules, prior to submitting entries.
x the rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.
x
x
xwhat is new in 1993:
x
x the entry format is better (for us anyway). the program mkentry.c
x has been updated. see entry format.
x
x we will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ansi c
x compiler. certain old obfuscation hacks that cause ansi c compilers
x fits are no longer permitted. some of the new issues deal with
x non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, c preprocessor
x directives and the exit() function. see our likes and dislikes.
x
x
xhints and suggestions:
x
x you are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests. see
x for more information for details on how to get previous winners.
x
x keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries
x may not be valid entries this year. what was unique and novel one year
x might be 'old' the next year.
x
x an entry is usually examined in a number of ways. we typically apply
x a number of tests to an entry:
x
x look at the original source
x convert ansi tri-graphs to ascii
x c pre-process the source ignoring ' include' lines
x c pre-process the source ignoring ' define' and ' include' lines
x run it through a c beautifier
x examine the algorithm
x lint it
x compile it
x execute it
x
x you should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.
x you should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been
x 'cleaned up' by the c pre-processor and a c beautifier.
x
x your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests. in certain
x cases, a test is not important. entries that compete for the
x 'strangest most creative source layout' need not do as well as
x others in terms of their algorithm. on the other hand, given
x two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that
x does something interesting when you run it.
x
x we try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules. as such, we leave
x the contest open for creative rule interpretation. as in real life
x programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request
x is important. for this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the
x rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.
x
x if you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know
x in the remarks section. please note that an invitation to abuse
x is not an invitation to break. we are strict when it comes to the
x 3217 byte size limit. also, abusing the entry format tends to
x annoy more than amuse.
x
x we do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries
x to attempt to exploit them. we will award 'worst abuse of the rules'
x and then plug the hole next year. even so, we will attempt to use
x the smallest plug needed, if not smaller. :-)
x
x check out your program and be sure that it works. we sometimes make
x the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly
x in or near the final round. on the other hand, we have seen some
x of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.
x
x we tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that
x 16 is a prime number. if you do have a bug, you are better off
x documenting it. noting ""this entry sometimes prints the 4th power
x of a prime by mistake"" would save the above entry. and sometimes,
x a strange bug feature can even help the entry! of course, a correctly
x working entry is best.
x
x
xour likes and dislikes:
x
x doing masses of defines to obscure the source has become 'old'. we
x tend to 'see thru' masses of defines due to our pre-processor tests
x that we apply. simply abusing defines or -dfoo bar won't go as far
x as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.
x
x many ansi c compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:
x
x define d define
x d foo , use instead.
x
x if you use c preprocessor directives ( define, if, ifdef, ...),
x the leading ' ' must be the first character on a line. while some
x c preprocessors allow whitespace the leading ' ', many do not.
x
x because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries
x must not assume that it returns an int.
x
x small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.
x while such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do
x serve a useful purpose. they are often the only program that people
x attempt to completely understand. for this reason, we look for
x programs that are compact, and are instructional.
x
x one line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80
x bytes long. getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.
x
x we tend to dislike programs that:
x
x are very hardware specific
x are very os or un x version specific
x (index strchr differences are ok, but socket streams specific
x code is likely not to be)
x dump core or have compiler warnings
x (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)
x won't compile under both bsd or sys v un x
x abusing the build file to get around the size limit
x obfuscate by excessive use of ansi tri-graphs
x are longer than they need to be
x are similar to previous winners
x are identical to previous losers :-)
x
x unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the
x 'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program
x in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.
x
x the build file should not be used to try and get around the size
x limit. it is one thing to make use of a several -d's to help out,
x but it is quite another to use 200 bytes of -d's in order to
x try and squeeze the source under the size limit. you should feel
x free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off
x if you show some amount of restraint.
x
x we allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; or do not impact
x your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get
x away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.
x
x given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob
x of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical c
x program, we tend to favor the second version. of course, a third
x version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting
x and or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!
x
x we suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'
x program. we are amazed at the many different sizes that claim
x to be the smallest. there is nothing wrong with self-replicating
x programs. in fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.
x you might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)
x know of a smaller one!
x
x x client entries should be as portable as possible. entries that
x adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored. don't
x depend on a particular type of display. for example, don't depend
x on color or a given size. don't require backing store.
x
x x client entries should avoid using x related libraries and
x software that is not in wide spread use. we ask that such x client
x entries restrict themselves to only the low level xlib and the
x athena widget set (libx11.a, libxaw.a, libxmu.a and libxt.a).
x don't use m tif, xv ew, or openl ok toolkits, since not everyone
x has them. avoid depending on a particular window manager. not
x everyone has x11r5, and some people are stuck back in x11r4 (or
x earlier), so try to target x11r5 without requiring x11r5. better
x yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 x window systems.
x
x x client entries should not to depend on particular items on
x .xdefaults. if you must do so, be sure to note the required lines
x in the ---remark--- section.
x
x we like programs that:
x
x are as concise and small as they need to be
x do something at least quasi-interesting
x pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)
x are portable
x are unique or novel in their obfuscation style
x make use of a number of different types of obfuscation
x make us laugh and or throw up :-)
x
x some types of programs can't excel in some areas. of course, your
x program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several
x areas really does help.
x
x we freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in
x the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning. if you had to
x read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.
x we think the readers of the contest winners do as well.
x
x be creative!
x
x
xentry format:
x
x in order to help us process the many entries, we must request your
x assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way. this format,
x in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the
x author from the program itself. (see judging process)
x
x we have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to
x format entries. you should be aware of the following warning that
x is found in mkentry.c:

x	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces
x	an entry that conforms to the contest rules. in all cases,
x	where this program differs from the contest rules, the
x	contest rules will be used. be sure to check with the
x	contest rules before submitting an entry.
x
x you are not required to use mkentry. it is convenient, however,
x as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check
x the entry against the size rules.
x
x if you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about
x the mkentry.c program, please send email to the judges. (see below)
x
x the following is a sample entry:

x we do not limit ourselves to this list. for example, a few entries are so
x good bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.
x we will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.
x
x in the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of
x reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10
x winners. often we are confident that the entries that make it into
x the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not
x make it. the selection of the winners out of the final round, is
x less clear cut.
x
x sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out
x by a similar, but slightly better entry. for this reason, it is
x sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry
x that failed to win in a previous year. this assumes, of course,
x that the entry is worth improving in the first place!
x
x more often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a
x strange creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest
x rules in some way.
x
x in the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'. sometimes such
x an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry. more often, the
x 'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.
x
x
xannouncement of winners:
x
x the first announcement, occurs at a summer usenix conference. by tradition,
x this is done during the latter part of the uunet ioccc bof, just prior to
x the berkeley bsd, and bsdi bof.
x
x winning entries will be posted in late june to the following groups:
x
x comp.lang.c comp.unix.wizards	alt.sources
x
x in addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following
x
x comp.sources.d alt.sources.d misc.misc
x comp.sources.misc comp.windows.x
x
x winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives. see
x below for details.
x
x often, winning entries are published in selected magazines. winners
x have appeared in books (""the new hackers dictionary"") and on t-shirts.
x
x last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames! :-)
x
x
xfor more information:
x
x you may contact the judges by sending email to the following address:

0. xt glossary
o the xt intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to c code
to allow useful graphical components to be created. included with
this are classes that provide the base functionality: object,
rectobj, core, composite, constraint, shell, overrideshell, wmshell,
etc. the terms ""xt"" and ""intrinsics"" are used interchangeably,
however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the x
window system. in particular, it does not include the athena,
motif, olit or any other widget set. without further widgets the
intrinsics are not especially useful.
o a widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via xt. the
precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the core class. it
is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the
object class although these are more accurately called windowless
widgets or gadgets.
o xlib is the c interface to the x11 protocol. it is one layer below
the xt intrinsics. typically a widget uses relatively few xlib
functions because xt provides most such services although an
understanding of xlib helps with problems.

3. why does my application core dump when i use signals alarms cthreads?
in brief, xlib, xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for
critical sections. any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of
the above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the
appropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a
list traversal, etc. note that the ansi c standard points out that
behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls
any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem
specific to xlib and xt; the posix specification mentions other
functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that
these functions are called by xlib or xt functions.
the only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the
interrupt handler. this flag later needs to be checked either by a
work procedure or a timeout callback. it is incorrect to add either
of these in the interrupt handler. as another note, it is dangerous
to add a work procedure that never finishes. this effectively
preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never
be called. another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop
about the read end using xtappaddinput() and then the signal handler
can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal.
however, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.
why don't the intrinsics deal with this problem? primarily because it
is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating
system. is that a good enough reason -- i don't think so.
note: the article in the x journal 1:4 and the example in o'reilly
volume 6 are in error.
4. how do i use a different visual than the default?
this requires a more complicated answer than it should. a window has
three things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and
border pixmap. all widgets have their own colormap and borderpixmap
resource; only shell widgets have visual resources (another questions
deals with why shells have a visual). the default value of these
resources is copyfromparent which does exactly what it says. in the
shell widget copyfromparent gets evalulated as defaultvisualofscreen
and defaultcolormapofscreen. when any one of the three resources is
not properly set, a badmatch error occurs when the window is
created. they are not properly set because each of the values depends
on the visual being used.
how to get this to work? there are two parts to the answer. the
first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual
and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application
to start with a different visual. the second is actually easier
because the basic information you need is available. the first is a
little harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkit
yourself in order to determine the needed information. some sample code to start up an application using something other than the default visual. to compile: cc -g visual.c -o visual -lxaw -lxmu -lxt -lxext -lx11 -lm to run: . visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual staticcolor -fg blue -bg yellow you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap to install. include include include typedef struct visual visual;

return (0); 5. which visual should an application use?
this is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is
no way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to
be specified by the user. if you disagree with this then your
application probably falls into the category of always using the
default visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular
visual such as 24bit truecolor with an overlayplane extension (or some
such).
why? no application runs in isolation. depending on the way a server
allocates resources i may not always want your application to run in
truecolor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications. i may
be very upset if it chooses to run in greyscale instead of psuedocolor
or just monochrome.
as an example, on a low end color sun server there are many different
possible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static
color, and a 3 3 2 truecolor. the sgi iris's offer all the above
plus 12 bit truecolor, 24 bit truecolor, an overlay plane.
6. why do only shell widgets have a visual?
this is strictly by convention. it makes it possible for an arbitrary
widget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the
shell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that
shell.
a widget can have its own visual resource. if it does, it must have
its own realize method to use the visual when it calls
xcreatewindow(). you should also make this a resource that can be
obtained with xtgetvalues() so other widgets can find it. a
reasonable value is probably xtnvisual.
7. which visual, depth and colormap do shells inherit?
the default value for these resources are set to copyfromparent. this
is interpreted as the defaultcolormapofscreen(), defaultdepthofscreen()
and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e.
it is an applicationshellwidgetclass and the root of your widget tree.
if the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies
colormap and depth from its parent and uses copyfromparent as the
visual.
8. i've done all the above and i still get a badmatch error. why?
some resource converters improperly cache references. this was
especially true of x11r3 and earlier versions of motif.
9. why doesn't my widget get destroyed when i call xtdestroywidget()?
see section 2.8 of the xt specification.
it eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately. the
intrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process. first it and all
of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed.
it is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed. this way any
pending x events or further references to that widget can be cleaned
up before the memory is actually freed. the second phase is then
performed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have
completed, before checking for the next x event. at this point the
list is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d, among
other things.
as some further caveats trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the
intrinsics determine that they have no further references to the
widgets on the list. if so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs
immediately. also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on
the destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not
destroyed until returning to the outer event loop.
10. how do i exit but still execute the destroycallbacks?
the problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting
an application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget
may not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open
sockets, temporary files, allocated x resources, etc. (this code for
simplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):
widget
toplevelget (gw)
widget gw; widget to find toplevel widget top;
for (top gw; xtparent (top); top xtparent (top)) empty ;
return (top); void
exitcallback (gw, closure, call data)
widget gw; widget xtpointer	closure; data the app specified xtpointer	call data; widget specific data widget toplevel;
toplevel toplevelget (gw);
xtunmapwidget (toplevel); make it disappear quickly xtdestroywidget (toplevel);
exit (0); one can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroying
the toplevel widget. the trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never
occur.
this works for most widgets and most applications but will not work
for those widgets that have any external state. you might think that
since it works now it will always work but remember that part of the
reason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant
of the implementation details for each widget. which means that the
widget may change and someday require that some external state is
cleaned up by the destroy callbacks.
one alternative is to modify exitcallback() to set a global flag and
then test for that flag in a private event loop. however, private
event loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and
difficult to maintain practices.
try the following code instead. include extern widget toplevelget ( if needfunctionprototypes
widget gw endif
);
extern boolean exitworkproc ( if needfunctionprototypes
xtpointer	closure endif
);
extern void exitcallback ( if needfunctionprototypes
widget gw,
xtpointer	closure,
xtpointer	call data endif
);
widget
toplevelget (gw)
widget gw; widget to find toplevel widget top;
for (top gw; xtparent (top); top xtparent (top)) empty ;
return (top); void
exitcallback (gw, closure, call data)
widget gw; widget xtpointer	closure; data the app specified xtpointer	call data; widget specific data widget toplevel;
toplevel toplevelget (gw);
xtunmapwidget (toplevel); make it disappear quickly xtdestroywidget (toplevel);
xtappaddworkproc (xtwidgettoapplicationcontext (gw),
exitworkproc, (xtpointer) null); boolean
exitworkproc (closure)
xtpointer	closure; exit (0); notreached exitcallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the
application is next idle -- which happens after all the events are
processed and the destroy callbacks are executed.
11. how do i resize a shell widget?
after it is realized, one doesn't resize a shell widget. the proper
thing is to resize the currently managed child of the shell widget
using xtsetvalues(). the geometry change is then propagated to the
shell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the
request. however, the shell must have the resource
xtnallowshellresize set to true otherwise it will not even ask the
window manager to grant the request and the shell will not resize.
to change the position of a shell, use xtsetvalues() on the shell, not
the child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.
12. why can't xtappaddinput() handle files?
it does, however unix semantics for when i o is ready for a file does
not fit most peoples' intuitive model. in unix terms a file
descriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not
block, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to
block. this works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes. for
a file the read() will always return but the return indicates an eof
calls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to
be read. the culprit is the select() system call or on sysv based
os's it is the poll() system call.
how to get around this on a unix system? the best approach is to use
another process to check for available input on the file. use a pipe
to connect the application with this other process and pass the file
descriptor from the pipe to xtappaddinput(). a suitable program on
bsd systems is ""tail -f filename"".
it's rumored that select() on some systems is not completely reliable. in particular:
- ibm aix 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while
(several thousand times) and then stop until some other
event woke it up. this seemed to be the result of a race
condition in the kernel. ibm claims to have a fix for this.
- pyramid, doesn't work at all.
- ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as
sockets), wasn't completely broken, but although the writing
side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it
all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at
a time. you can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks
(get raound it by detecting the situation and having
select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had
been given the whole block).
note that all the above descriptions used unix terminology such as
read(), file descriptor, pipes, etc. this is an os dependent area and
may not be identical on all systems. however the intrinsic designers
felt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with
part of the toolkit. why they didn't also deal with signals at this
point i don't know.
13. what good books and magazines are there on xt?
i have a favorite that is the definitive reference. to my perspective
it offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full
details of the intrinsics. when i started using it i was already
familiar with xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or may
not find it useful. i've always found it accurate and complete, which
means its a 1000 pages.
asente, paul j., and swick, ralph r., ""x window system toolkit, the
complete programmer's guide and specification"", digital press,
1990, isbn 1-55558-051-3, order number ey-e757e-dp; and by
prentice-hall, isbn 0-13-972191-6. also available through dec
direct at 1-800-digital.
the other book i commonly recomend to novices is:
young, doug. ""the x window system: applications and programming with
xt (motif version),"" prentice hall, 1989 (isbn 0-13-497074-8).
(isbn 0-13-972167-3)
and of course o'reilly has an entire series of manuals on x and xt.
o'reilly ordering is 800-998-9938. in particular, volume 5 is an xt
reference done in manual page style. the 3rd edition is extensively
overhauled and goes far beyond the mit manual pages. i'm finding it
very useful. in particular, the permutted index and references to
other manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related
information.
i read two periodicals, ""the x resource"" and the ""the x journal"".
these are the only two dealing specifically with x. ""the x resource""
is published quarterly, by o'reilly, with one of the issues being the
mit x consortium technical conference proceedings. there is no
advertising. i've found it informative with pretty good depth. for
orders, call 1-800-998-9938, or email for editorial
matters, email table of contents are posted at
math.utah.edu in ftp pub tex bib in tex form and on ftp.uu.net in ftp published oreilly xresource in ascii form.
""the x journal"" is a bimonthly trade rag with lots of advertising.
the articles are informative and oriented toward a less technical
audience. i read it more to see what's going on then with an
expectation of learning a great deal (but remember, i represent a
fairly small percentage of people). also, they have a pretty good
collection of people on the advisory board and as columnists. call
(908) 563-9033.
14. what widgets are available?
there are three popular widget sets:
athena	- the set provided with x11. this is sufficient for most
purposes but is on the ugly side. recently, a 3d look is
available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib xaw3d.tar.z.
motif	- from osf available for a license fee and commonly shipped on
many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but
sun). it looks good and works well but personally i think
it is poorly implemented.
olit	- the open look intrinsics toolkit is a set of widgets
implementing sun's open look specification. developed by
at t. i've never used it so can't comment on its quality.
i've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.
in addition the following collection of widgets are also available:
xtra	- a library of widgets for sale from graphical software
technology (310-328-9338). it includes bar graph, stacked
bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help,
spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets. i've never seen
them so i can't comment.
fwf	- the free widget foundation is attempting to collect a set of
freely available widgets. included are a pixmap editor,
filedialog, and a few others. the current set of widgets
can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine
a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub fwf.shar.z.
xcu	- the cornell university widgets from gene dykes. one of the
early widget sets released. provides a nice appearance for
buttons and has a mini command language. probably not so
widely used.
xs	- the sony widget set. this was around during r3 days but
seemed to disappear. it looked like it had promise.
xw	- the hp widgets. the precursor to motif. originally written
for r3 there exists diffs to get it to work under r4 r5.
again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died.
the precursor to this was the xray toolkit which was
originally implemented for x10r4 and apparently provided
much experience for the designers of xt.
xo	- a widget set i'm working on. it's still primitive but you
can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub xo the following specialized widgets are also available:
tbl	- implements a tabular layout of widgets. supports motif
widgets as children. part of wcl.
plots	- the athena plotting widgets (not the athena widgets).
contact or 15. what alternatives to the intrinsics are there? name language	vendor xview c sun
oi c parcplace
interviews	c stanford
tcl tk c sprite.berkeley.edu however much i like c and admire the skill in both designing and
implementing the intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop
in the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language. keep
your eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language
other than c starts gaining acceptance.
16. how do i pass a float value to xtsetvalues?
first, what is going wrong is the structure for an arg is (essentially)
typdef struct string	name;
long	value; arg;
and the code:
arg	arg;
xtsetarg (arg, ""name"", 3.2)
expands to
arg	arg;
arg.name ""name"";
arg.value 3.2;
you can see that with normal c type conversions, the arg.value
gets the integer ""3"" instead of the floating point value ""3.2"". when
the value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is
wildly different than that required for a floating point value. so,
how to get around this?
the following macro is from the athena widgets document and i am now
recomending it over the previous suggestions. define xtsetfloatarg(arg, n, d) if (sizeof(float) sizeof(xtargval)) xtsetarg(arg, n, (d)); else xtargval ld (xtargval ) (d); xtsetarg(arg, n, ld); 17. how do i write a resource converter?
courtesy of rich thomson the following discussion of resource converters assumes r4 (or r5)
intrinsics. resource converters changed between r3 and r4 to allow
for destructors and caching of converted values.
there are several main types of resource converters:
string to data type
data type to string
data type to data type
i) string to data type
usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings
that will be converted to data type values. this is most often
used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:
name value
""true"" 1
""false"" 0
in this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare
the resource value to the list of fixed strings. this is most
readily accomplished by the use of the ""quark"" mechanism of the
resource manager. the resource value is turned into a quark,
which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a
single word. then the resource quark is compared against the
quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.
if there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many
converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then
a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the
resource strings into quarks. that way, the first time one of
these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks
and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one
of the converters.
ii) data type to string
this type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data
type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary. instead,
the data type value is simply converted to a string value,
probably by the use of sprintf.
data type to string converters are useful for applications that
wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that
they can write out a valid resource specification to a file. this
mechanism can be used to provide a ""snapshot"" of application state
into a file. this snapshot can be used to restore the program to
a known state via the usual x resource database mechanisms.
if you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type
converter, it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to
string converter. writing both at the same time helps to ensure
that they are consistent.
iii) data type to data type
this type of converter is used to convert an existing data type
value to another data type. for instance, an x pixel value can be
converted to an rgb data type that contains separate fields for
red, green and blue.
the type signature for a resource converter is as follows:
typedef boolean ( xttypeconverter)(display , xrmvalueptr, cardinal ,
xrmvalueptr, xrmvalueptr, xtpointer );
display dpy;
xrmvalueptr args;
cardinal num args;
xrmvalueptr fromval;
xrmvalueptr toval;
xtpointer converter data;
when the converter is invoked, the ""fromval"" argument points to the source
x resource manager value and the ""toval"" argument points to the
destination x resource manager value. the ""converter data"" argument
is an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified
when the converter is registered. the ""args"" and ""num args"" arguments
allow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is
invoked. for instance, the pixel to rgb structure converter discussed
above would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the
pixel to obtain the rgb values corresponding to that pixel.
care must be taken with the ""toval"" argument. an xrmvalue has the
following type definition and specifies a size and location for a
converted value:
typedef struct unsigned int size;
caddr t addr; xrmvalue, xrmvalueptr;
when the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of
the given size for the converted value or the location can be null.
in the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the
destination area is large enough to handle the converted value. if
the destination area is not large enough, then the converter should
set the size to the amount of space needed and return false. the
caller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the
converter. if the size is large enough, then the converter can simply
copy the converted value into the space given and return true.
if the location is null, then the converter can assign the location to
the address of a static variable containing the converted value and
return true.
when writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it
becomes convenient to define a macro: define done(var, type) if (toval- addr) if (toval- size size sizeof(type); return false; else ((type ) toval- addr) var; else toval- addr (caddr t) var; toval- size sizeof(type); return true; define donestr(str) if (toval- addr toval- size size sizeof(string); return false; else toval- addr (caddr t) str; toval- size sizeof(string); return true;
inside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety
checking on the ""num args"" and ""args"" arguments to ensure that your
converter is being called properly.
once you have written your converter, you need to register it with the
intrinsics. the intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating
widgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.
to register a converter with a single application context, use
xtappsettypeconverter:
void xtappsettypeconverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num args,
cache, destructor)
xtappcontext context;
string from;
string to;
xttypeconverter converter;
xtconvertarglist args;
cardinal num args;
xtcachetype cache;
xtdestructor destructor;
to register a converter with all application contexts, use
xtsettypeconverter:
void xtsettypeconverter(from, to, converter, args, num args,
cache, destructor)
string from;
string to;
xttypeconverter converter;
xtconvertarglist args;
cardinal num args;
xtcachetype cache;
xtdestructor destructor;
in the r3 intrinsics, there were the routines xtappaddconverter and
xtaddconverter; these have been superseded by xtappsettypeconverter
and xtsettypeconverter. whenever possible, the newer routines should be
used.
when a converter is registered with the intrinsics, a ""cache"" argument
specifies how converted resource values are to be cached:
xtcachenone don't cache any converted values
xtcacheall cache all converted values
xtcachebydisplay	cache converted values on a per display basis
caching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a
good idea (for instance string to pixel conversions).
the ""destructor"" argument is a routine that is invoked then the
resource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has
been decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is
being destroyed. xtdestructor has the following type definition:
typedef void ( xtdestructor)(xtappcontext, xrmvalueptr, xtpointer,
xrmvalueptr, cardinal );
xtappcontext context;
xrmvalueptr to;
xtpointer converter data;
xrmvalueptr args;
cardinal num args;
the destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated
with the ""to"" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed
to by the ""to"" argument itself (to- addr). the destructor is passed
the extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the
conversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments
for the string to pixel converter since the destructor would need to
free the allocated pixel from the colormap) as well as the private
data passed in when the converter was registered.
sample converter code can be found in the following files in the mit
r5 distribution:
mit lib xt converters.c
contrib lib pext converters.c
contrib lib pext converters.h
18. how do i open multiple displays?
see ""multi-user application software using xt"", the x resource, issue 3,
(summer 1992) by oliver jones for a complete coverage of the issues
involved. most of this answer is based on that article. in a
nutshell, one uses xtopendisplay() to add each display to a single application context and then xtclosedisplay() to shutdown each display
and remove it from the application context.
the real problems occur when trying to close down a display. this can
happen 3 ways:
1. user selects a ""quit"" button on one of the displays,
2. user has window manager send a wm delete window message,
3. server disconnect -- possibly from a killclient message,
server shutdown crash, or network failure.
i'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 2 since it is merely a
problem of translating a widget to a display and removing that
display. if not, then read the oliver jones article.
the third one is difficult to handle. the following is based on the
oliver jones article and i include it here because it is a difficult
problem.
the difficulty arises because the xlib design presumed that an i o
error is always unrecoverable and so fatal. this is essentially true
for a single display x based application, but not true for a
multiple display program or an application that does things other than
display information on an x server. when an x i o error occurs the
i o error handler is called and if it returns then an exit()
happens. the only way around this is to use setjmp longjmp to avoid
returning to the i o error handler. the following code fragment
demonstrates this: include jmp buf xiorecover;
void
xiohandler (dpy)
display dpy; destroydisplay (dpy);
longjmp (xiorecover, 1); main () ...
if (setjmp (xiorecover) 0)
xsetioerrorhandler (xiohandler);
xtappmainloop (app context); the destroydisplay() is something that given a display pointer can go
back to the application specific data and perform any necessary
cleanup. it should also call xtclosedisplay().
for those of you unfamiliar with setjmp longjmp, when setjmp() is
first called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in the
jmp buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to
the same state as if the setjmp() was just executed. the return value
of this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to
longjmp(). there are several caveats about using these but for this
purpose it is adequate.
some other problems you might run into are resource converters that
improperly cache resources. the most likely symptoms are xlib errors
such as badcolor, badatom, or badfont. there may be problems with the
total number of displays you can open since typically only a limited
number of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical
value. you may also run into authorization problems when trying to
connect to a display.
there was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in
november of 91. robert scheifler posted an article which basically
said this is the way it will be and xlib will not change.
19. what changed from r3 to r4 to r5?
this addresses only changes in the intrinsics. first, the general
changes for each release are described. then a, certainly incomplete,
list of new functions added and others that are now deprecated are
listed. brevity is a primary goal.
much of the following information is retrieved from chapter 13 of the mit
xt intrinsics manual and from o'reilly volume 5, 3rd edition.
from r3 to r4
- addition of gadgets (windowless widgets)
- new resource type converter interface to handle cacheing and
additional data.
- variable argument list interface.
- define xtspecificationrelease 4 (added with this release)
- wmshellpart, toplevelshellpart transientshellpart changed
incompatibly.

xtopendisplay, xtdisplayinitialize, and xtinitialize were changed
from cardinal to int - many performance improvements (this is summarized from the article
""xt performance improvements in release 5"" by gabe beged-dov in ""the
x resource"", issue 3):
- xrmstringtoquark() augmented with xrmpermstringtoquark() to
avoid string copies. several fields in the class record are
indicated as needing permanent strings.
- using an array of strings for resources
- callback lists redesigned to use less memory
- translation manager redesigned and rewritten so it takes
less memory, translation tables merges are faster, cache of
action bindings

20. where are the resources loaded from?
the resources of a widget are filled in from the following places
(from highest priority to lowest priority):
1. args passed at creation time.
2. command line arguments.
3. user's per host defaults file
4. user's defaults file.
5. user's per application default file.
6. system wide per application default file.
note that 2-6 are read only once on application startup. the result
of steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.
the per host defaults file contains customizations for all
applications executing on a specific computer. this file is either
specified with the xenvironment environment variable or if that is not
set then the file home .xdefaults- is used.
the user defaults file is either obtained from the resource manager
property on the root window of the display or if that is not set then
the file home .xdefaults is used. typically, the program ""xrdb"" is
used to set the resource manager property. please note that this
should be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the
display must transfer the property. a size of around 1-3kbyte is
reasonable. some toolkits may track changes to the resource manager
but most do not.
a user may have many per application default files containing
customizations specific to each application. the intrinsics are quite
flexible on how this file is found. read the next part that describes
the various environment variables and how they effect where this file
is found.
the system wide per application default files are typically found in usr lib x11 app-defaults. if such a file is not found then the
fallback resources are used. the intrinsics are quite flexible on how
this file is found. read the next part that describes the various
environment variables and how they effect where this file is found. thanks to oliver jones for the following, 6 92 you can use several environment variables to control how resources are
loaded for your xt-based programs -- xfilesearchpath,
xuserfilesearchpath, and xapplresdir. these environment variables
control where xt looks for application-defaults files as an
application is initializing. xt loads at most one app-defaults file
from the path defined in xfilesearchpath and another from the path
defined in xuserfilesearchpath.
set xfilesearchpath if software is installed on your system in such a
way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory
hierarchies. suppose, for example, that you are running sun's open
windows, and you also have some r4 x applications installed in usr lib x11 app-defaults. you could set a value like this for
xfilesearchpath, and it would cause xt to look up app-defaults files
in both usr lib x11 and usr openwin lib (or wherever your
openwinhome is located):
setenv xfilesearchpath usr lib x11 t n: openwinhome lib t n
the value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of
pathnames. the pathnames contain replacement characters as follows
(see xtresolvepathname()): n	the value of the filename parameter, or the
application's class name. t	the value of the file ""type"". in this case, the
literal string ""app-defaults"" c	customization resource (r5 only) s	suffix. none for app-defaults. l	language, locale, and codeset (e.g. ""ja jp.euc"") l	language part of l (e.g. ""ja"") t	the territory part of the display's language string c	the codeset part of the display's language string
let's take apart the example. suppose the application's class name is
""myterm"". also, suppose open windows is installed in usr openwin.
(notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.) usr lib x11 t n means usr lib x11 app-defaults myterm openwinhome lib t n means usr openwin lib app-defaults myterm
as the application initializes, xt tries to open both of the above
app-defaults files, in the order shown. as soon as it finds one, it
reads it and uses it, and stops looking for others. the effect of
this path is to search first in usr lib x11, then in usr openwin.
let's consider another example. this time, let's set
xuserfilesearchpath so it looks for the file myterm.ad in the current
working directory, then for myterm in the directory app-defaults.
setenv xuserfilesearchpath . n.ad: home app-defaults n
the first path in the list expands to . myterm.ad. the second expands
to home app-defaults myterm. this is a convenient setting for
debugging because it follows the imake convention of naming the
app-defaults file myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so
you can run the application from the directory in which you are
working and still have the resources loaded properly.
note: when looking for app-default files with xuserfilesearchpath,
for some bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is
defined so t and s are useless.
with r5, there's another twist. you may specify a customization
resource value. for example, you might run the ""myterm"" application
like this:
myterm -xrm "" customization: -color""
if one of your pathname specifications had the value
"" usr lib x11 app-defaults n c"" then the expanded pathname would be
"" usr lib x11 app-defaults myterm-color"" because the c substitution
character takes on the value of the customization resource.
the default xfilesearchpath, compiled into xt, is: usr lib x11 l t n c: (r5) usr lib x11 l t n c: (r5) usr lib x11 t n c: (r5) usr lib x11 l t n: usr lib x11 l t n: usr lib x11 t n
(note: some sites replace usr lib x11 with a projectroot in this
batch of default settings.)
the default xuserfilesearchpath, also compiled into xt, is l n c: (r5) l n c: (r5) n c: (r5) l n: l n: n: is either the value of xapplresdir or the user's home directory
if xapplresdir is not set. if you set xuserfilesearchpath to some
value other than the default, xt ignores xapplresdir altogether.
notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find
your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set
xapplresdir to ""."", a single dot. in r3, all this machinery worked
differently; for r3 compatibilty, many people set their xapplresdir
value to "". "", a dot followed by a slash.
21. what order are callbacks executed in?
(courtesy of donna converse, 5 10 92)
the intrinsics library do not guarantee an order. this is because
both the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to
modify the entire contents of the callback list. neither one
currently knows what the other is doing and so the intrinsics cannot
guarantee the order of execution.
the application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the
widget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and
remove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have;
therefore the functionality contained in a callback should be
independent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the
list.
even though the xt standard in the definition of xtaddcallback
says:
""callback name: specifies the callback list to which the
procedure is to be appended.""
you may not infer from the word ""appended"" that the callback routines
are called in the same order as they have been added to the callback
list.
22. how do i know if a widget is visible?
(courtesy of donna converse, 5 14 92)
right, everything is implemented correctly. this demonstrates a ""deficiency""
in the x protocol, and the core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the
protocol. (the ""deficiency"" is that the information is available in one way,
in this case an inconvenient way.) the xt specification is accurate, in
the second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section
carefully. the visible field will not change in response to iconification.
a visibilitynotify event will not be received when the window goes from
viewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped;
that is, when iconification occurs. this is the protocol deficiency.
visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the x protocol;
see the glossary in your xlib and x protocol reference manual.
you'll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.
as an application writer, keep track with a global boolean in an action
routine with translations for mapnotify and unmapnotify on the shell widget
which contains your custom widget. as the custom widget writer, see the
map state field returned by a call to xgetwindowattributes. these are
suggestions.
23. how do i reparent a widget in xt, i.e. xtreparentwidget()?
you can't.
24. why use xtmalloc, xtfree, etc?
unfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc()
tends to ignore the possibility of returning null. at best it is
handled something like:
ptr (type ) malloc (sizeof (type))
if (!ptr) perror (""malloc in xyzzy()"");
exit (1) to handle this common case the intrinsics define the functions
xtmalloc(), xtcalloc(), xtnew(), xtnewstring() and xtrealloc() which
all use the standard c language functions malloc(), calloc() and
realloc() but execute xterrormsg() if a null value is returned. xt
error handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.
in addition, if xtrealloc() is called with a null pointer, it uses
xtmalloc() to get the initial space. this allows code like:
if (!ptr)
ptr (type ) malloc (sizeof (type));
else
ptr (type ) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) (count 1)); count;
to be written as:
ptr xtrealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) count);
also, xtfree() accepts a null pointer as an argument. generally, i've
found the xt functions conveniant to use. however, anytime i'm
allocating anything potentially large i use the standard functions so
i can fully recover from not enough memory errors.
xtnew() and xtnewstring() are conveniant macros for allocating a
structure or copying a string:
struct abc xyzzy;
char ptr;
char str ""abcdef"";
xyzzy xtnew (struct abc); takes care of type casting ptr xtnewstring (str);
a strict interpretation of the intrinsics reference manual allow an
implementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with
malloc() and free(). i.e. code such as:
char ptr;
ptr xtmalloc (100); ... free (ptr);
may not work. personally, i'd call any implementation that did this
broken and complain to the vendor.
a common error for motif programmers is to use xtfree() on a string
when they should really be using xmstringfree().
25. how to debug an xt application?
first, i'd recomend getting ""purify"" from pure software. this is a
great package for tracing memory problems on sun's. it's a bit pricey
at 2750 but i'd still recomend it. excuse the marketing blurb
(contact for more info).
purify inserts additional checking instructions directly into
the object code produced by existing compilers. these
instructions check every memory read and write performed by
the program under test and detect several types of access
errors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past
malloc'd bounds, or writing to freed memory. purify inserts
checking logic into all of the code in a program, including
third party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies
system call interfaces. in addition, purify tracks memory
usage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel
adaption of garbage collection techniques. purify's nearly
comprehensive memory access checking slows the target program
down typically by a factor of two to five.
an alternative package that isn't as pricey ( 395 for a sun), runs on
many unix's and has pretty similar features is ""the sentinel debugging
environment"". this replaces malloc() and several other c library
functions to add additional checks. (contact for more info)
next, if you are getting any sort of xlib error, you'll need to run in
synchronous mode, easily accomplished with the ""-sync"" command line
argument or by setting the variable xdebug to 1 with your debugger. then
set a break point in exit(). this will let you trace back to the
original xlib function being called. if you don't run in synchronous
mode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to
xlib previously since the xlib calls are buffered and replies from the
server are asynchronous.
next, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the
undocumented resource ""xtidentifywindows"" or the class resource
""xtdebug"" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window.
for example:
example xload -xrm ' xtdebug:true' example xwininfo -tree will give the normal information but the widget name and class of each
window is included. this can help for checking the location and size
of errant widgets.
next, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to
test the way a widget manages it's children, you can try
export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib libxtgeo.tar.z. this acts as a filter
between any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour
of both. it's a very clever idea.
the most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the
application is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from
a pulldown menu). the server effectively locks up and you'll need to
go to another machine and kill the debugger manually. the server
locks up because the application being debugged has said no one else
can have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped
waiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands.
unfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going to
your application which is stopped.
the best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on
your desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment)
on one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly
using a command sequence like this:
othermachine xhost thismachine
thismachine setenv display othermachine:0;
thismachine gdb application your favorite debugger.
or this:
othermachine xhost thismachine
thismachine gdb application
(gdb) set environment display othermachine:0
(gdb) run ...
i believe codecenter, a c interpreter graphical debugger has a method
of dealing with this by explicitely calling the xlib functions to
release any grabs during breakpoints.
debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and
knowledge of how widgets work. you can go a long way without knowing
the internals of a particular widget but not very far without
understanding how a widget works. judicious use of conditional
breakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great
deal.
26. why don't xtaddinput(), xtaddtimeout() and xtaddworkproc() work?
i have got a delicate problem with the three routines xtaddinput,
xtaddtimeout and xtaddworkproc. the problem i have is that when
i use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.
i have made a handy little testprogram where everything works
perfect, but in my ""real"" application nothing happens.
the introduction in r3 of the xtapp () functions obsoleted those
routines (see q19 for other changes in r3, r4, and r5). what happens is
they use a default application context different then the one you may
have created. since events and timeouts are distributed on a per
application context basis and you are using two application contexts,
you won't get those events.
for example:
...
cnt 0;
toplevel xtappinitialize( app, class,
desc, xtnumber (desc), argc, argv,
fallback, args, cnt);
xtaddtimeout (...)
xtaddworkproc (...)
xtappmainloop (app)
would never invoke the timeout.
27. what is and how can i implement drag and drop?
(courtesy of roger reynolds, 19 feb 93)
drag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an intuitive'' fashion.
motif version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, openlook has
supported d-n-d all along. the two protocols are not compatable with
each other, and so far as i know, they are not published.
i wrote a package called rdd which is designed to be a flexible public
protocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients. my
intention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to
support a ""standard"" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop
and contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long
as it is based on xt).
the implementation is based upon my understanding of the icccm
conventions, for more details read the code.
i have heard from dozens of people using rdd who like it and feel that
it works a whole lot better than motif 1.2 stuff. also, there seem to
be many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use motif
anyway.
the latest rdd (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from
netcom.com, in pub rogerr. a (possibly older) version is also
available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib.

you that there is good support for it in teleuse. in teleuse you can call any
c method from a ""d"" module. what you can do then is to use the ""d"" language
for most of your interface code and then use c for you application code.
i should tell you that there is some real neat stuff coming out of teleuse soon
in regard to c , but i can't give you many details. you should talk to your local sales rep and get the lowdown on what they will be doing in the near furture.

66400.eml,comp.windows.x,"i'm trying to write a motif program on an interactive unix machine, and i'm
observing very strange behavior when my program attempts to expose a
drawingarea. namely, some xlib operations work, and some do not. in
particular, the expose consist of two xfillrectangle calls followed by some
xdrawpoint calls, and for reasons unknown to me the point calls are failing
whenever a pulldown or popup up menu is (clicked on and) moved in the
rightward direction over the drawing area, but after the move, is still on
some part of the drawing area. this also happens less consistently when the
pulldown popup is moved in the leftward direction.
assuming that my code is not doing anything incredibly odd, is this a server

x 1) your entry must be a complete program.
x
x 2) your entry must be this is a new entry, y this replaces an older entry)
xtitle:	title of entry (see comments below)
xentry:	entry number from 0 to 7 inclusive (your 1st entry should by 0)
xdate:	date time of submission in utc (see comments below)
xhost:	machine(s) and os(s) under which your entry was tested
x	use tab indented lines if needed
x---remark---
x place remarks about this entry in this section. it would be helpful if
x you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a
x requirement. also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th
x column. blank lines are permitted.
x---author---
xname:	your name
xorg:	school company organization
xaddr:	postal address
x	use tab indented lines to continue
x	don't forget to include the country
xemail: email address from a well known site or registered domain.
x if you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines.
xanon:	y or n (y remain anonymous, n ok to publish this info)
x---info---
xif your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in
xthis section. in the case of multiple info files, use multiple info
xsections. if your entry does not need a info file, skip this section.
x---build---
xplace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile build your program
xin this section. it must uudecode into a file named 'build'. the resulting
xfile must be 255 bytes or less.
x---program---
xplace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section. it must uudecode
xinto a file named is 'prog.c'. the resulting file must follow rule 2.
x---end---
x
x regarding the above format:
x
x the title must match the expression: a-za-z0-9 a-za-z0-9 - x and must be 1 to 12 characters in length.
x
x it is suggested, but not required, that the title should
x incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors,
x consider using parts of the usernames of the authors.
x
x the date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect
x to utc. the format of the date should be as returned by asctime()
x using the c locale. (see guidelines for more info)
x
x you may correct revise a previously submitted entry by sending
x it to the contest email address. be sure to set 'fix' in the
x ---entry--- section to 'n'. the corrected entry must use the same
x title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected. be
x sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well.
x
x with the exception of the header, all text outside of the above
x format may be ignored by the judges. if you need tell the judges
x something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate
x email message to the judges.
x
x information from the ---author--- section will be published unless
x 'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line.
x
x to credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for
x each author. each should start with ---author--- line, and
x should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections.
x
x the entry's remarks should include:
x - what this program does
x - how to run the program (sample args or input)
x - special compile or execution instructions, if any
x - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5)
x - information about any ---data--- files
x - why you think the program is obfuscated
x - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry.
x - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise)
x
x do not rot13 your entry's remarks. you may suggest that certain
x portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award.
x
x info files should be used only to supplement your entry. they
x should not be required to exist.
x
x if your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info---
x section. if your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple
x ---info--- sections, one per info file. you should describe
x each info file in the ---remark--- section.
x
x 4) if your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:
x
x 'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed
x 'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional
x digit, followed by '.c'
x your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's
x title, possibly followed by a digit
x
x if your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your
x entry's remark section. the makefile will be arranged to execute a
x build shell script containing the 'build' information. the name of
x this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed
x by a digit, followed by '.sh'.
x
x if needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must
x be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.
x
x 5) the build file, the source and the resulting executable should be
x treated as read-only files. if your entry needs to modify these files,
x it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file. if this
x occurs, state so in your entry's remarks.
x
x 6) entries that cannot be compiled by an ansi c compiler will be rejected.
x use of common c (k r extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not
x cause compile errors for ansi c compilers.
x
x 7) the program must be of original work. all programs must be in the
x public domain. all copyrighted programs will be rejected.
x
x 8) entries must be received prior to 07-may-93 0:00 utc. (utc is
x essentially equivalent to greenwich mean time) email your entries to:
x
x ...! apple,pyramid,sun,uunet !hoptoad!obfuscate
x x
x we request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'.
x
x if possible, we request that you hold off on emailing your entries
x until 1-mar-93 0:00 utc. early entries will be accepted, however.
x we will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for
x all entries received after 1-mar-93 0:00 utc.
x
x 9) each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year. each entry
x must be sent in a separate email letter.
x
x 10) entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed.
x compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be executed.
x
x 11) programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, super-user,
x special owner or group) are not allowed.

x
xabout this file:
x
x this file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to
x the international obfuscated c code contest (ioccc for short).
x
x this is not the ioccc rules, though it does contain comments about
x them. the guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.
x entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are
x allowed. even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.
x
x you should read the current ioccc rules, prior to submitting entries.
x the rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.
x
x changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars. --- x
x
xwhat is new in 1993:
x
x the entry format is better (for us anyway). the program mkentry.c
x has been updated. see entry format.
x
x we will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ansi c
x compiler. certain old obfuscation hacks that cause ansi c compilers
x fits are no longer permitted. some of the new issues deal with
x non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, c preprocessor
x directives and the exit() function. see our likes and dislikes.
x
x
xhints and suggestions:
x
x you are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests. see
x for more information for details on how to get previous winners.
x
x keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries
x may not be valid entries this year. what was unique and novel one year
x might be 'old' the next year.
x
x an entry is usually examined in a number of ways. we typically apply
x a number of tests to an entry:
x
x look at the original source
x convert ansi tri-graphs to ascii
x c pre-process the source ignoring ' include' lines
x c pre-process the source ignoring ' define' and ' include' lines
x run it through a c beautifier
x examine the algorithm
x lint it
x compile it
x execute it
x
x you should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.
x you should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been
x 'cleaned up' by the c pre-processor and a c beautifier.
x
x your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests. in certain
x cases, a test is not important. entries that compete for the
x 'strangest most creative source layout' need not do as well as
x others in terms of their algorithm. on the other hand, given
x two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that
x does something interesting when you run it.
x
x we try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules. as such, we leave
x the contest open for creative rule interpretation. as in real life
x programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request
x is important. for this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the
x rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.
x
x if you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know
x in the remarks section. please note that an invitation to abuse
x is not an invitation to break. we are strict when it comes to the
x 3217 byte size limit. also, abusing the entry format tends to
x annoy more than amuse.
x
x we do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries
x to attempt to exploit them. we will award 'worst abuse of the rules'
x and then plug the hole next year. even so, we will attempt to use
x the smallest plug needed, if not smaller. :-)
x
x check out your program and be sure that it works. we sometimes make
x the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly
x in or near the final round. on the other hand, we have seen some
x of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.
x
x we tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that
x 16 is a prime number. if you do have a bug, you are better off
x documenting it. noting ""this entry sometimes prints the 4th power
x of a prime by mistake"" would save the above entry. and sometimes,
x a strange bug feature can even help the entry! of course, a correctly
x working entry is best.
x
x
xour likes and dislikes:
x
x doing masses of defines to obscure the source has become 'old'. we
x tend to 'see thru' masses of defines due to our pre-processor tests
x that we apply. simply abusing defines or -dfoo bar won't go as far
x as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.
x
x many ansi c compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:
x
x define d define
x d foo , use instead.
x
x if you use c preprocessor directives ( define, if, ifdef, ...),
x the leading ' ' must be the first character on a line. while some
x c preprocessors allow whitespace the leading ' ', many do not.
x
x because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries
x must not assume that it returns an int.
x
x small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.
x while such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do
x serve a useful purpose. they are often the only program that people
x attempt to completely understand. for this reason, we look for
x programs that are compact, and are instructional.
x
x one line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80
x bytes long. getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.
x
x we tend to dislike programs that:
x
x are very hardware specific
x are very os or un x version specific
x (index strchr differences are ok, but socket streams specific
x code is likely not to be)
x dump core or have compiler warnings
x (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)
x won't compile under both bsd or sys v un x
x abusing the build file to get around the size limit
x obfuscate by excessive use of ansi tri-graphs
x are longer than they need to be
x are similar to previous winners
x are identical to previous losers :-)
x
x unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the
x 'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program
x in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.
x
x the build file should not be used to try and get around the size
x limit. it is one thing to make use of a several -d's to help out,
x but it is quite another to use 200 bytes of -d's in order to
x try and squeeze the source under the size limit. you should feel
x free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off
x if you show some amount of restraint.
x
x we allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; or do not impact
x your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get
x away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.
x
x given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob
x of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical c
x program, we tend to favor the second version. of course, a third
x version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting
x and or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!
x
x we suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'
x program. we are amazed at the many different sizes that claim
x to be the smallest. there is nothing wrong with self-replicating
x programs. in fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.
x you might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)
x know of a smaller one!
x
x x client entries should be as portable as possible. entries that
x adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored. don't
x depend on a particular type of display. for example, don't depend
x on color or a given size. don't require backing store.
x
x x client entries should avoid using x related libraries and
x software that is not in wide spread use. we ask that such x client
x entries restrict themselves to only the low level xlib and the
x athena widget set (libx11.a, libxaw.a, libxmu.a and libxt.a).
x don't use m tif, xv ew, or openl ok toolkits, since not everyone
x has them. avoid depending on a particular window manager. not
x everyone has x11r5, and some people are stuck back in x11r4 (or
x earlier), so try to target x11r5 without requiring x11r5. better
x yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 x window systems.
x
x x client entries should not to depend on particular items on
x .xdefaults. if you must do so, be sure to note the required lines
x in the ---remark--- section.
x
x we like programs that:
x
x are as concise and small as they need to be
x do something at least quasi-interesting
x pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)
x are portable
x are unique or novel in their obfuscation style
x make use of a number of different types of obfuscation
x make us laugh and or throw up :-)
x
x some types of programs can't excel in some areas. of course, your
x program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several
x areas really does help.
x
x we freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in
x the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning. if you had to
x read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.
x we think the readers of the contest winners do as well.
x
x be creative!
x
x
xentry format:
x
x in order to help us process the many entries, we must request your
x assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way. this format,
x in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the
x author from the program itself. (see judging process)
x
x we have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to
x format entries. you should be aware of the following warning that
x is found in mkentry.c:
x
x	this program attempts to implement the ioccc rules. every
x	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces
x	an entry that conforms to the contest rules. in all cases,
x	where this program differs from the contest rules, the
x	contest rules will be used. be sure to check with the
x	contest rules before submitting an entry.
x
x you are not required to use mkentry. it is convenient, however,
x as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check
x the entry against the size rules.
x
x if you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about
x the mkentry.c program, please send email to the judges. (see below)
x
x the following is a sample entry:
x
x---entry---
xrule:	1993
xfix:	n
xtitle:	chonglab
xentry:	0
xdate:	mon mar 1 08:45:20 1993
xhost:	un x v6, pdp11 45
x	2.9bsd, pdp11 70
x---remark---
x this is a non-obfuscated obfuscated c program.
x
x it is likely not to win a prize. but what do you expect from
x a short example!

x we do not limit ourselves to this list. for example, a few entries are so
x good bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.
x we will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.
x
x in the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of
x reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10
x winners. often we are confident that the entries that make it into
x the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not
x make it. the selection of the winners out of the final round, is
x less clear cut.
x
x sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out
x by a similar, but slightly better entry. for this reason, it is
x sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry
x that failed to win in a previous year. this assumes, of course,
x that the entry is worth improving in the first place!
x
x more often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a
x strange creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest
x rules in some way.
x
x in the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'. sometimes such
x an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry. more often, the
x 'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.
x
x
xannouncement of winners:
x
x the first announcement, occurs at a summer usenix conference. by tradition,
x this is done during the latter part of the uunet ioccc bof, just prior to
x the berkeley bsd, and bsdi bof.
x
x winning entries will be posted in late june to the following groups:
x
x comp.lang.c comp.unix.wizards	alt.sources
x
x in addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following
x
x comp.sources.d alt.sources.d misc.misc
x comp.sources.misc comp.windows.x
x
x winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives. see
x below for details.
x
x often, winning entries are published in selected magazines. winners
x have appeared in books (""the new hackers dictionary"") and on t-shirts.
x
x last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames! :-)

x
xhow to have your contest included in this file:
x
x if you wish the ioccc judges to include your contest in this file,
x send a request to:
x
x x
x we request that contest descriptions be limited to 50 lines and to
x not exceed 2500 bytes. we typically request that your contest
x include a current description of the ioccc.
x
x in order to be included in this file for given year, we must
x receive a current description no earlier than jan 1 00:00:00 utc and
x no later than feb 15 00:00:00 utc. agreement to publish your
x contest must also be obtained prior to feb 15. annual contests
x that fail to submit a new entry will be dropped from this file.
x
xofficial disclaimer: (pardon the officialese)
x
x the contents noted below, other than the ioccc, are not affiliated
x with the ioccc, nor are they endorsed by the ioccc. we reserve the
x right to refuse to print information about a given contest.
x
x the information below was provided by the particular contest
x organizer(s) and printed by permission. please contact the
x contest organizer(s) directly regarding their contents.
x
xwith that official notice given, we present for your enjoyment, the following
xinformation about contents:

x---------------------------------------------------------------------------
x
x 10th international obfuscated c contest
x
x	""the original obfuscated contest""
x
x obfuscate: tr.v. -cated, -cating, -cates. 1. a. to render obscure.
x b. to darken. 2. to confuse: their emotions obfuscated
x their judgment. llat. obfuscare, to darken : ob(intensive) x lat. fuscare, to darken fuscus, dark. -obfuscation n.
x obfuscatory adj.
x
x goals of the contest:
x
x to write the most obscure obfuscated c program under the rules below.
x to show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way.
x to stress c compilers with unusual code.
x to illustrate some of the subtleties of the c language.
x to provide a safe forum for poor c code. :-)
x
x the ioccc is the grandfather of usenet programming contests. since
x 1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that simply works
x correctly is not sufficient. the ioccc has also done much to add
x the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the english language.
x (see ""the new hacker's dictionary"" by eric raymond)
x
x you are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before
x sending any entries. the rules, and sometimes the contest email
x address itself, change over time. a valid entry one year may
x be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules. the typical
x start date for contests is in early march. contest rules are normally not
x finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest. the typical
x closing date for contests are in early may.
x
x the rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to
x year. you should be sure you have the current rules and guidelines
x prior to submitting entries. to obtain them, send email to the address
x above and use the subject 'send rules'.
x
x one may obtain winners of previous contests (1984 to date), via ftp from:
x
x	host: ftp.uu.net	(192.48.96.9)
x	user: anonymous
x	pass: x	dir: pub ioccc
x
x as a last resort, previous winners may be obtained by sending email
x to the above address. please use the subject 'send year winners',
x where year is a single 4 digit year, a year range, or 'all'.

x 0th international obfuscated perl contest
x	by: landon noll larry wall
x
x this content is being planned. someday when landon larry are not too
x busy, they will actually get around to posting the first set of rules!
x
x landon says: ""yes, i know that i said we would have a contest in 1993,
x but other existing projects got in the way. hopefully
x something will be developed after nov 1993.""

x
x 2nd international obfuscated postscript contest
x jonathan monsarrat x alena lacova x
x a contest of programming skills and knowledge, exclusively for the
x postscript programming language. its purpose:
x
x to spread knowledge of postscript and its details.
x to applaud those with the best tricks.
x to prove that humans can beat those damnable machine generators at
x their own game by writing the most obscure and mysterious postscript
x programs ever.
x
x winners will receive the fame and attention that goes with having their
x program entry posted as a winner to programmers world-wide.
x
x the 1993 contest rules and results are available by ftp as
x wilma.cs.brown.edu:pub postscript obfuscated .shar'', or individually
x in the obfuscated directory. the judges will post the 1994 rules
x in november to comp.lang.postscript on usenet, and other places.
x send questions to x
x categories include: best obfuscated postscript, best artwork,
x most compact, best interactive program, most useful, and
x anything so unusual and creative that it deserves an award.
x
x the judges will choose the winners of each category.
x
x alena lacova is a system administrator at nikhef (institute for high
x energy and nuclear physics) in the netherlands. she is the author of
x the postscript chaos programs, which draw julia sets, mandelbrot sets
x and other kinds of fractal functions.
x
x jonathan monsarrat is a graduate student from mit and brown university
x in the u.s.a. he is the faq maintainer for the usenet newsgroup
x comp.lang.postscript and the author of the postscript zone and lametex.

66411.eml,comp.windows.x,"i've been using the xmgraph widget that's been floating around and i
noticed the performance is significantly better using gadgets, perhaps
even 100 faster. i had heard in an old programming course that gadgets
were no longer any benefit to performance, and that it's just as well
to use widgets everywhere. so why would 50 pushbutton gadgets be a lot
quicker than 50 pushbuttons in the graph? should i start putting gadgets
back into my long pulldown menus?

66421.eml,comp.windows.x,"at robert gordon university, programming was the main (most time-consuming)
start of the course. the first two years consisted of five subjects:
software engineering (pascal c unix), computer engineering (6502 6809 68000
assembler), computer theory (lisp prolog), mathematics statistics and
communication skills (how to pass interviews intelligence tests and group
discussions e.g. how to survive a helicopter crash in the north sea).
the third year (industrial placement) was spent working for a computer company
for a year. the company could be anywhere in europe (there was a special
travel allowance scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors).
the fourth year included operating systems(c modula-2), software engineering
(c 8086 assembler), real time laboratory (c 68000 assembler) and computing
theory (lisp). there were also group projects in 2nd and 4th years, where
students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an
outside company (the only disadvantage being that specifications would change
suddenly).
in the first four years, there was a 50 :50 weighting between courseworks and
exams for most subjects. however in the honours year, this was reduced to a
30 :70 split between an individual project and final exams (no coursework
assessment) - are all computer science courses like this?
btw - we started off with 22 students in our first year and were left with 8 by
honours year. also, every course is tutored separately. not easy trying
to sleep when you are in 8 student class :-).

this faq includes information on a number of ""gotchas"" that can bite
you on particular system. however, the best source of general information on
building the x11 release is found in the release notes. the file is bundled
separately from the rest of the release, so if it's become separated from your
sources you can ftp another copy separately: the file relnotes. ms,ps,txt at
the top of the distribution. the file relnotes is also available from the
xstuff mail server.
in addition, o'reilly associates's volume 8 on x administration

subject: 94) why doesn't my sun with a cg6 work with r5?
apparently gcc is the problem; it seems to produce fine code for all
sun displays except for the cgsix. the new sungx.o distributed with fix-07
may fix the problem (note: not known to work on solaris).
subject: 95) why doesn't my sun with sunos 4.1 know about dlsym, etc.?
if you get errors with dlsym dlopen dlclose undefined, link with
libdl.a. add ""-ldl"" to your and eventually your site.def. you may want to
surround it with ""-bstatic -ldl -bdynamic"" if you add it to the extra libraries
variable, since ""syslibs"" get added after extra libraries on the eventual
compilation command; otherwise you may not have a shared libdl. (or compile
the stubs shared.) thanks to joe backo 12 91 subject: 96) what is this strange problem building x clients on sunos 4.1.2?
in sunos 4.1.2 sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflicts
with the way x11r4 builds the shared xmu library, causing these symbols to be
undefined when building some x11 clients: get wmshellwidgetclass get applicationshellwidgetclass
compiling ""-bstatic -lxmu -bdynamic"" appears to work.
to solve the problem if you are using openwindows 3.0 (x11r4-based xt), please
contact your local sun office and request the following patches:

subject: 97) why can't gcc compile x11r4 on my sparc?
i used gcc to compile the whole distribution, but i get several segmentation
faults when running x.
note first that gcc on risc machines does not necessarily result in
any performance increase; it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the
680x0 or vax platforms.
here is the problem: gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing
structures as arguments and returning them as function values, so when
gcc-compiled parts of x are linked with sun-supplied functions that pass or
return structs, run-time errors occur. affected programs include rgb and
the server.
this is from the gcc manual:
on the sparc, gnu cc uses an incompatible calling convention for
structures. it passes them by including their contents in the argument
list, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by
reference.
this really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet
supported in gnu cc, so it isn't straightforward to fix it.
the convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and -fpcc-struct-return' does not help.
you can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just
the routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with
compilation flags.
files which need to be compiled using cc include:
server os 4.2bsd oscolor.c
rgb rgb.c
in addition, several of the ""inet "" functions use structs as args or
return values:
clients xhost xhost.c
clients xauth gethost.c.
calls to inet addr in lib clx socket.c and lib x xconndis.c are possibly
harmless as they don't involve structs. collected by (don bashford); 8 90 subject: 98) what are these i o errors running x built with gcc?
when i try to run xinit or the xsun server i get the error
""getting interface configuration: operation not supported on socket.
fatal server bug! no screens found.""
running the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't work. you can do
this simple test: include siocgifconf
run that through cc -e and gcc -e. the last line of output is the piece of
interest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like
whitespace). if the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i', your
fixincludes run didn't work for some reason or other; go back to your gcc
sources and run fixincludes ; then rebuild the x distribution. if they are
identical, try running a make clean in mit server and rebuilding, just to make
sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files. courtesy der mouse, 9 90 subject: 99) what are these problems compiling x11r4 on the older sun3?
in mit server ddx sun suncg3c.c, we have found ""missing"" defines for
cg3ac monolen, cg3bc monolen, cg3ac enblen, cg3bc enblen. what should these be?
the r4 errata list distributed after x11r4 mentions that you can add
these lines to the file on older sunos versions (e.g. 3.5) to compile: define cg3ac monolen (128 1024) define cg3ac enblen cg3ac monolen define cg3bc monolen cg3ac monolen define cg3bc enblen cg3ac monolen
however, the sun3 should not actually ever have the cg3 device, and so
references to it can be removed from mit server ddx sun suninit.c and the
imakefile. 11 90 subject: 100) what are these problems compiling the x server on sunos 4.1.1?
the file isn't being found.
sun omitted from sunos 4.1.1. remove the include
from suncg6c.c and replace it with the line define cg6 vaddr color 0x70016000
the file has changed from earlier versions of sunos and should not be copied
from another distribution.
subject: 101) what are these problems using r4 shared libraries on sunos 4?
all of the executables that i try to run have the following results:
ld.so: libxmu.so.4: not found
or even:
ld.so: call to undefined procedure gethostname from 0xf776a96c
if you are building with shared libraries on a sun, remember that you
need to run ""ldconfig"" as root after installing the shared libraries (if you've
installed x on a file-server, run it on the server's clients, too). while
building and installing the distribution, you need to be careful to avoid
linking against any existing x shared libraries you might have (e.g. those
distributed with openwindows). you should make sure you do not have
ld library path set in your environment during the build or the installation.
if you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs, please note that
the shared libraries must be installed in usr lib, usr local lib, or usr 5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked
statically). courtesy mit x consortium note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it
attempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed.
you can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -bstatic to
most c compilers).
subject: 102) can olit programs run with r5 xt? ( xtqstring undefined)
this is a bug in the olit. xtqstring was an external symbol that existed in
x11r4 (upon which ow 3.0's libxt is based). it wasn't documented and was
removed in x11r5 (mit's guarantee of upward compatibility between the r4 and r5
libraries only applied to the documented interface).
a workaround is to temporarily set your ld library path to point to the x11r4
or openwindows xt library that you linked the program against. 10 92; from barry margolin 3 93 from jeff francis subject: 103) how do i get around the sunos 4.1 security hole?
there is a security problem with certain r4 clients (xterm and xload)
running under sunos 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using
shared libraries; to avoid the problem, do one of these:
1) make the program non-setuid. you should consult your system
administrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and dev kmem) used
by these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security
problems at your site.
2) relink the programs statically (using -bstatic).
3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths
to the libraries. from (bob scheifler), 12 90 the r5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the
newly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suid
program from being built with libraries specified relatively. note that this
may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from nfs-mounted disks.
xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem.
subject: 104) how do i get around the frame-buffer security hole?
on many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits
anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by
accessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhaps
more annoying, to accidentally start up a second x session on your console
display. check the man page for fbtab(5). thanks to art mulder 2 93. subject: 105) topic: building x programs
subject: 106) what is imake?
imake is not a replacement for the make program; instead, it is a
makefile-generator that takes advantages of the include-file and macro-
processing capabilities of the c preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles
suitable for building software on a particular system. although it is not
specific to x, the x release uses it to help solve a number of the
configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable.
imake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by
which the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration
files, and individual imakefiles are melded to produce a makefile is not
obvious.
there have been several different versions of imake; the r3, r4, and
r5 versions are different.
you can obtain information on imake from these sources:
- the r4 and r5 release notes and imake man page include information on
using imake to build x
- the r4 and r5 file mit config readme also contains useful information
- on the r4 tapes, contrib doc imake imake.tex is mark moraes' r3 r4
guide to imake.
- the r5 mit doc config usenixws paper.ms contains a paper by jim
fulton on an early version of imake
- paul dubois has written a useful
explanation of how imake works and how to use it in configuring x for non-
supported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu
in the directory ftp pub imake-stuff; look for config-x11r4.ms (troff) and
config-x11r4.ps (postscript). some supplemental appendices are nearby. 7 91: document version is now 1.06 these imake papers are available by email;
mail a message body of ""send imake-stuff help"" to - see ""system administration - imake: friend of foe?"" by dinah mcnutt
in the november 1991 issue of sunexpert.
- german readers should expect in june 1992 an article ""das meta-make i make, you make schwerelos"" by rainer klute in ""ix
multiuser-multitasking-magazin"", directed at application programmers needing to
write imakefiles. an english-language derivative of this article is in the
x journal, issue 2:1.
- the o'reilly x resource issue 2 contains paul davey's article on
demystifying imake.
- alain brossard's working document full of tips on imake is in
sasun1.epfl.ch:pub imakefile.1.z. 1 91;12 91;5 92;8 92 subject: 107) where can i get imake?
versions are distributed with the r4 and r5 releases. an earlier
version is distributed with the x11r3 release; some third-party toolkits
redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the
template and configuration files. there are no real standards for such
configuration files, although most current contributed software expects the
templates distributed with x11r5.
export contains the r5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imake
without picking up the entire distribution.
a stand-alone version of imake, but one stemming from x11r5, is in
ftp.germany.eu.net:pub x11 misc imake imake-pure.tar.z (192.76.144.75).
subject: 108) i have a program with an imakefile but no makefile. what to do?
if you have r4 or r5 installed on your system, run ""xmkmf"". this is a
script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. the output is a
makefile configured for your system and based on the imakefile. then run make,
which will use that new makefile to compile the program.
subject: 109) why can't i link to the xlib shape routines?
when i try to compile certain programs, i get the following link error:
undefined: xshapequeryextension xshapecombinemask
these routines are actually part of the shape extension to x (shape)
which was introduced in the mit x11r4 distribution and allows non-rectangular
windows. like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will
only run on a server which supports it. pre-x11r4 servers, as well as many
vendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case
they will display rectangular windows anyway.
in order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library
libxext.a. in the x11r4 distribution, this library and the associated includes
will be in the mit extensions directory. if you do not have these files, do
not despair: many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be
compiled without it by removing the -dshape define from the makefile; you can
probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied x
libraries. from john b. melby, 3 91 subject: 110) what are these problems with "" xtinherit not found"" on the sun?
when i run a x program that i wrote on a sunos 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine i get the
error ""ld.so: symbol not found xtinherit"".
what you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the r4 libxt.a to
get sun shared libraries working. apparently, you can't share a function that
is both called and compared, as xtinherit is. this was handled by putting xtinherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby
guaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in initialize.c, where
xttoolkitinitialize() and xtinitialize() reside. these routines would normally
be called.
you are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal
xt-based program and does not call xttoolkitinitialize() anywhere.
1) it may be a program that uses xt functions but never opens a
connection to the x server. osf motif's 1.1.0 uil had this problem; it called
xtmalloc() and other xt functions. the solution is to add the call to your
program; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in.
2) alternatively, your program doesn't need any xt functions and is
correct in not calling xttoolkitinitialize() -- it may be an xlib or xview
program. in this case, you can remove -lxt from your link command.
it should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically,
although this will certainly solve the problem. from jordan hayes (now and danny backx 11 90 subject: 111) why can't i compile my r3 xaw contrib programs under the new x?
i have a program that worked well under x11r3. when i try to link it under
the current version of x, i get this message:
undefined: xtscrollbarsetthumb xttextsetinsertionpoint xttextreplace
there were several name changes in the athena widget set (in addition
to the header files moving into ); these are mentioned in the r4
release notes. in this case, these functions are not really xt functions but
are part of the xaw text widget and so have been renamed from xt to xaw . 10 90 subject: 112) topic: programming problems and puzzles
subject: 113) why doesn't my program get the keystrokes i select for (sic)?
the window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one
window to another. in order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the
window manager for the input focus. to do this, you must set up what are
called ""hints"" for the window manager. if your applications is xlib-based, you
can use something like the following:
xwmhints wmhints;
...
wmhints.flags inputhint;
wmhints.input true;
xsetwmhints(dpy, window, wmhints)
if your application is based on the xt intrinsics, you can set the xtninput
resource to be true (as you probably want to in any case); if you don't have
source, you can start up the application with the resource ' input:true'.
certain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having
this done.
if you are using sun's openwindows olwm, you can also add this resource
to your defaults file to use clients that aren't icccm-compliant.
openwindows.focuslenience: true mostly courtesy dave lemke of ncd and stuart marks of sun subject: 114) how do i figure out what window manager is running?
you can't reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be
spoofed in any case.
for most cases, you shouldn't care which window manager is running, so
long as you do things in an icccm-conformant manner. there are some cases in
which particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for
particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can
sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. alternatively, it may
be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take
advantage of specific added features (such as olwm's push-pin menus) in order
to give your program added functionality. beware of usurping the window
manager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing;
this surely leads to future compatibility problems.
subject: 115) is there a skeleton x program available?
there is no general framework such as the transskel program for the
macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development
under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional
development. in x, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive
application builder tool or by using cut paste on existing x applications. good
applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to ""test just
this one little thing"" include contrib clients xskel, a simple r4 program that
puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for
quick hacks, the xaw examples in the examples directory in the r3 and r4
distributions, and the xlib ""hello world"" example in the r3 doc helloworld and
r4 doc tutorials helloworld; an updated version of this program which uses r4
xlib calls and current icccm conventions was posted in 2 90 to comp.windows.x
by glenn widener of tektronix. 3 90 in addition, a sample xt program (for xaw or xm) by rainer klute
showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display
connection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib mdisp.tar.z. 4 92 subject: 116) why does xtgetvalues not work for me (sic)?
the xtgetvalues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is
sensitive to the type of variable. your code may be doing something like this: arg args 3 ;
int i;
int sensitive; oops; wrong data type i 0;
xtsetarg (args i , xtnsensitive, sensitive); i ;
xtgetvalues(widget, args, i );
... but xtnsensitive is a boolean, which on most machines is a single byte;
declaring the variable ""sensitive"" as boolean works properly. this problem
comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the xt types
dimension and position; code that assumes they are int will have similar
problems if those types are actually short. in general: you are safe if you
use the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget's man page. 11 90 subject: 117) why don't xtconfigurewidget xtresizewidget xtmovewidget work?
you're probably trying to use these functions from application code.
they should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a
parent widget to change the geometry of its children. other promising
functions, xtmakegeometryrequest() and xtmakeresizerequest(), are also for use
only by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent.
the only way for your application to request a geometry change for a
widget is to issue an xtsetvalues call setting some of the geometry resources.
although this will result in the widget-internal functions' being called, your
application code must use the standard xtsetvalues interface or risk the
widgets' data becoming corrupted. the xlib calls xmovewindow() and xresizewindow() should similarly be
avoided; they shouldn't be used to change xtnx, xtny, xtnwidth, or xtnheight. subject: 118) why isn't there an xtreparentwidget call like xreparentwindow?
although there are various details of the current implementation of
the xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that no
such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for
the ""new"" widget should be. resources are typically set based on the location
in the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves?
what should happen to the widget's children? and by the time such semantics are
defined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old
widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired
resources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in
creating a new widget.
note that reparenting is possible in the oi toolkit.

although some books demonstrate that the current implementation of xt
happens to call callback procedures in the order in which they are registered,
the specification does not guarantee such a sequence, and supplemental
authoritative documents (i.e. the asente swick volume) do say that the order is
undefined. because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and
the application, xt cannot guarantee the order of execution.
in general, the callback procedures should be thought of as operating
independently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of other
callbacks operating; if a seqence is needed, then the single callback to be
registered can explicitly call other functions necessary. 4 92; thanks to subject: 122) why doesn't xtdestroywidget() actually destroy the widget?
xtdestroywidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leaving
dangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not
actually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop.
subject: 123) how do i query the user synchronously using xt?
it is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback,
which has a clear flow of control. the calls to askuser() block until answer
is set to one of the valid values. if it is not a ""yes"" answer, the code drops
out of the callback and back to an event-processing loop:
void quit(widget w, xtpointer client, xtpointer call) int answer;
answer askuser(w, ""really quit?"");
if (ret yes answer) answer askuser(w, ""are you really positive?"");
if (ret yes answer)
exit(0); a more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether
to overwrite it.
this is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and
waiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the
calling function. that function askuser() looks something like this, where the
motif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of
dialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for ""ok"", ""cancel"" and
""help"" or equivalents:
int askuser(w, string)
widget w;
char string; int answer ret none; some not-used marker widget dialog; could cache carry, but ... arg args 3 ;
int n 0;
xtappcontext context;
n 0;
xtsetarg(args n , xmnmessagestring, xmstringcreateltor(string,
xmstring default charset)); n ;
xtsetarg(args n , xmndialogstyle, xmdialog application modal); n ;
dialog xmcreatequestiondialog(xtparent(w), string, args, n);
xtaddcallback(dialog, xmnokcallback, response, answer);
xtaddcallback(dialog, xmncancelcallback, response, answer);
xtaddcallback(dialog, xmnhelpcallback, response, answer);
xtmanagechild(dialog);
context xtwidgettoapplicationcontext (w);
while (answer ret none xtapppending(context)) xtappprocessevent (context, xtimall); xtdestroywidget(dialog); blow away the dialog box and shell return answer; the dialog supports three buttons, which are set to call the same
function when tickled by the user. the variable answer is set when the user
finally selects one of those choices:
void response(w, client, call)
widget w;
xtpointer client;
xtpointer call; int answer (int ) client;
xmanycallbackstruct reason (xmanycallbackstruct ) call;
switch (reason- reason) case xmcr ok: answer ret yes; some define value break;
case xmcr cancel: answer ret no;
break;
case xmcr help: answer ret help;
break;
default:
return; and the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed and
continues from there. thanks to dan heller further code is in dan's r3 contrib

i have a widget id and need to know what the name of that widget is.
users of r4 and later are best off using the xtname() function, which
will work on both widgets and non-widget objects.
if you are still using r3, you can use this simple bit of code to do
what you want. note that it depends on the widget's internal data structures
and is not necessarily portable to future versions of xt, including r4. include include string xtname (widget)
widget widget; will work with non-widget objects return xrmnametostring(widget- core.xrm name); 7 90; modified with suggestion by larry rogers 9 91 subject: 125) why do i get a baddrawable error drawing to xtwindow(widget)?
i'm doing this in order to get a window into which i can do xlib graphics
within my xt-based program:
the window associated with the widget is created as a part of the
realization of the widget. using a window id of null (""no window"") could
create the error that you describe. it is necessary to call xtrealizewidget()
before attempting to use the window associated with a widget.
note that the window will be created after the xtrealizewidget() call,
but that the server may not have actually mapped it yet, so you should also
wait for an expose event on the window before drawing into it.
subject: 126) why do i get a badmatch error when calling xgetimage?
the badmatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of
the screen. if you don't want to catch the error and deal with it, you can take
the following steps to avoid the error:
1) make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture.
2) clear the pixmap to background using xfillrectangle.
3) use xcopyarea to copy the window to the pixmap.
4) if you get a noexpose event, the copy was clean. use xgetimage to grab the
image from the pixmap.
5) if you get one or more graphicsexpose events, the copy wasn't clean, and
the x y width height members of the graphicsexpose event structures tell you
the parts of the pixmap which aren't good.
6) get rid of the pixmap; it probably takes a lot of memory. 10 92; thanks to oliver jones subject: 127) how can my application tell if it is being run under x?
a number of programs offer x modes but otherwise run in a straight
character-only mode. the easiest way for an application to determine that it is
running on an x display is to attempt to open a connection to the x server:
display xopendisplay(display name);
if (display) do x stuff else do curses or something else where display name is either the string specified on the command-line following
-display, by convention, or otherwise is (char )null in which case
xopendisplay uses the value of display, if set .
this is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line
argument or checking for display set in the environment, neither of which is
adequate. 5 91 subject: 128) how do i make a ""busy cursor"" while my application is computing?
is it necessary to call xdefinecursor() for every window in my application?
the easiest thing to do is to create a single inputonly window that is
as large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel
window and it will be clipped to that window, so it won't affect any other
application. (it needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the
user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual
desktop.) substitute ""toplevel"" with your top-most widget here (similar code
should work for xlib-only applications; just use your top window):
unsigned long valuemask;
xsetwindowattributes attributes; ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. valuemask cwdontpropagate cwcursor;
attributes.do not propagate mask (keypressmask keyreleasemask buttonpressmask buttonreleasemask pointermotionmask);
attributes.cursor xcreatefontcursor(xtdisplay(toplevel), xc watch); the window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by
its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing xcreatewindow(xtdisplay(toplevel), xtwindow(toplevel), 0, 0,
65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, inputonly,
copyfromparent, valuemask, attributes);
where the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen,
particularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than
32767.
when you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back to
normal, unmap it. this will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse
events; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may not
have a similar effect on keystrokes as well.
in addition, note also that most of the xaw widgets support an xtncursor
resource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change the
cursor without blocking pointer events. thanks to andrew wason dan heller and 11 90,5 91 subject: 129) how do i fork without hanging my parent x program?
an x-based application which spawns off other unix processes which
continue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its
children are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open x
connection to the display.
what you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process,
close (connectionnumber(xtdisplay(widget)));
to close the file-descriptor in the display information. after this do your
exec. you will then be able to exit the parent.
alternatively, before exec'ing make this call, which causes the file
descriptor to be closed on exec.
(void) fcntl(connectionnumber(xdisplay), f setfd, 1); thanks to janet anstett gordon freedman 2 91. greg holmberg 3 93. subject: 130) can i make xt or xlib calls from a signal handler?
no. xlib and xt have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical
sections. if your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which
might be while the function you are calling is already executing), it can leave
the library in an inconsistent state. note that the ansi c standard points
out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls
any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to
xlib and xt; the posix specification mentions other functions which may be
called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by
xlib or xt functions.
you can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt
handler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which
has previously been added.
note: the article in the x journal 1:4 and the example in o'reilly
volume 6 are in error. thanks to pete ware and donna converse 5 92 subject: 131) what are these ""xlib sequence lost"" errors?
you may see these errors if you issue xlib requests from an xlib error
handler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate x requests to xt or
xlib from a signal handler, which you shouldn't be doing in any case.
subject: 132) how can my xt program handle socket, pipe, or file input?
it's very common to need to write an xt program that can accept input
both from a user via the x connection and from some other file descriptor, but
which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the x connection or
the other file descriptor.
a solution is use xtappaddinput(). after you open your file descriptor,
use xtappaddinput() to register an input handler. the input handler will be
called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your
program's attention. write the input handler like you would any other xt
callback, so it does its work quickly and returns. it is important to use only
non-blocking i o system calls in your input handlers.
most input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an
input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish.
be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file.
you will find that the function is called even when there isn't input pending.
xtappaddinput() is actually working as it is supposed to. the input handler is
called whenever the file descriptor is ready to be read, not only when there is
new data to be read. a disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always
ready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginning
and read data you've read before. the result is that your function will almost
always be called every time around xtappmainloop(). there is a way to get the
type of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your
function to test whether there is new data:
if (ioctl(fd, fionread, n) -1 n 0) return;
but, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a
busy-wait; you may be better off not using xtappaddinput() and instead setting
a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input. courtesy dan heller 8 90; 5 91;
ollie jones 6 92 subject: 133) how do i simulate a button press release event for a widget?
you can do this using xsendevent(); it's likely that you're not setting
the window field in the event, which xt needs in order to match to the widget
which should receive the event.
if you're sending events to your own application, then you can use
xtdispatchevent() instead. this is more efficient than xsendevent() in that you
avoid a round-trip to the server.
depending on how well the widget was written, you may be able to call
its action procedures in order to get the effects you want. courtesy mark a. horstman 11 90 subject: 134) why doesn't anything appear when i run this simple program?
you are right to map the window before drawing into it. however, the
window is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen --
until your application receives an expose event. drawing done before that will
generally not appear. you'll see code like this in many programs; this code
would appear after window was created and mapped:
while (!done) xnextevent(the display, the event);
switch (the event.type) case expose: on expose events, redraw xdrawline(the display,the window,the gc,5,5,100,100);
break;
... note that there is a second problem: some xlib implementations don't
set up the default graphics context to have correct foreground background
colors, so this program could previously include this code:
...
the gc values.foreground blackpixel(the display,the screen); e.g. the gc values.background whitepixel(the display,the screen); e.g. the gc xcreategc(the display,the window,
gcforeground gcbackground, the gc values);
...
note: the code uses blackpixel and whitepixel to avoid assuming that 1 is
black and 0 is white or vice-versa. the relationship between pixels 0 and 1
and the colors black and white is implementation-dependent. they may be
reversed, or they may not even correspond to black and white at all.
also note that actually using blackpixel and whitepixel is usually the wrong
thing to do in a finished program, as it ignores the user's preference for
foreground and background.
and also note that you can run into the same situation in an xt-based program
if you draw into the xtwindow(w) right after it has been realized; it may
not yet have appeared.
subject: 135) what is the difference between a screen and a screen?
the 'screen' is an xlib structure which includes the information about
one of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single x display supports. a
server can support several independent screens. they are numbered unix:0.0,
unix:0.1, unix:0.2, etc; the 'screen' or 'screen number' is the second digit --
the 0, 1, 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available
screens on this particular display connection.
the macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular
screen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- one
which takes a screen and one with takes both the display and the screen number.
in xt-based programs, you typically use xtscreen(widget) to determine
the screen on which your application is running, if it uses a single screen.
(part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros
which return characteristics of the screen have ""display"" in the names --
xdisplaywidth, xdisplayheight, etc.)

information is available from donna converse, subject: 138) can xgetwindowattributes get a window's background pixel pixmap?
no. once set, the background pixel or pixmap of a window cannot be
re-read by clients. the reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap,
set it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. the
window keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed. if you're
sure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use xcleararea()
to clear a region to the background color and then use xgetimage() to read
back that pixel. however, this action alters the contents of the window, and
it suffers from race conditions with exposures. courtesy dave lemke of ncd
and stuart marks of sun note that the same applies to the border pixel pixmap. this is a
(mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the
pixel pixmap however it wants. by not requiring the server to keep the
original pixel or pixmap, some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved. courtesy jim fulton, mit x consortium subject: 139) how do i create a transparent window?
a completely transparent window is easy to get -- use an inputonly
window. in order to create a window which is mostly transparent, you have
several choices:
- the shape extension first released with x11r4 offers an easy way to
make non-rectangular windows, so you can set the shape of the window to fit the
areas where the window should be nontransparent; however, not all servers
support the extension.
- a machine-specific method of implementing transparent windows for
particular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware. note
that there is no x notion of a ""transparent color index"".
- a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny
windows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult.
- a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent
window or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application
window with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors
that will appear properly. thanks to der mouse, 3 92; see also
the x journal 1:4 for a more complete answer, including code samples for this
last option subject: 140) why doesn't gxxor produce mathematically-correct color values?
when using gxxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a
background of black, for example, should produce white. however, the drawing
operation does not work on rgb values but on colormap indices. the color that
the resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually
random unless you have actually filled it in yourself. on many x servers black
and white often 0 1 or 1 0; programs taking advantage of this mathematical
coincidence will break. if you want to be combining colors with gxxor, then you should be
allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen
pre-computed values.
if you want to use gxxor simply to switch between two colors, then you
can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the gc (graphics
context) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over
red, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red.
this foreground value is itself the xor of the colormap indices of red and
blue. thanks to chris flatters and ken whaley 2 91 subject: 141) why does every color i allocate show up as black?
make sure you're using 16 bits and not 8. the red, green, and blue
fields of an xcolor structure are scaled so that 0 is nothing and 65535 is
full-blast. if you forget to scale (using, for example, 0-255 for each color)
the xalloccolor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is
usually black. thanks to paul asente, 7 91 subject: 142) why can't my program get a standard colormap?
i have an image-processing program which uses xgetrgbcolormap() to get the
standard colormap, but it doesn't work.
xgetrgbcolormap() when used with the property xa rgb default map does
not create a standard colormap -- it just returns one if one already exists.
use xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first. 1 91; from der mouse subject: 143) why does the pixmap i copy to the screen show up as garbage?
the initial contents of pixmaps are undefined. this means that most
servers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there
xfillrectangle() with a function of gxcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever
color you want as your background (or 0l if you are using the pixmap as a
mask). courtesy dave lemke of ncd and stuart marks of sun subject: 144) how do i check whether a window id is valid?
my program has the id of a window on a remote display. i want to check whether
the window exists before doing anything with it.
because x is asynchronous, there isn't a guarantee that the window
would still exist between the time that you got the id and the time you sent an
event to the window or otherwise manipulated it. what you should do is send the
event without checking, but install an error handler to catch any badwindow
errors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists. this scheme will
work except on the rare occasion that the original window has been destroyed
and its id reallocated to another window. courtesy ken lee 4 90 subject: 145) can i have two applications draw to the same window?
yes. the x server assigns ids to windows and other resources (actually,
the server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that
knows the id can manipulate the resource almost any x server resource, except
for gcs and private color cells, can be shared .
the problem you face is how to disseminate the window id to multiple
applications. a simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the
applications' running on different machines) is in the first application to
create a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window id into
it. the second application then retrieves the property, whose name it also
knows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window. note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first
application running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned
in the question about using window ids on remote displays. note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level
cooperation among your applications.
note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to
use the same server connection. if one process is a child of the other, it
should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection. mostly courtesy phil karlton 6 90 subject: 146) why can't my program work with tvtwm or swm?
a number of applications, including xwd, xwininfo, and xsetroot, do not
handle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use; they typically return
the wrong child of root. a general solution is to add this code or to use it in
your own application where you would normally use rootwindow(dpy,screen): function name: getvroot description: gets the root window, even if it's a virtual root arguments: the display and the screen returns: the root window for the client include window getvroot(dpy, scr)
display dpy;
int scr; window rootreturn, parentreturn, children;
unsigned int numchildren;
window root rootwindow(dpy, scr);
atom swm vroot none;
int i; swm vroot xinternatom(dpy, "" swm vroot"", false);

window newroot null;
if (xgetwindowproperty(dpy, children i , swm vroot, 0, 1,
false, xa window, actual type, actual format, nitems, bytesafter, (unsigned char ) newroot) success newroot) root newroot;
break; return root; courtesy david elliott similar code is in ssetroot, a
version of xsetroot distributed with tvtwm. 2 91 a header file by andreas stolcke of icsi on export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib vroot.h
functions similarly by providing macros for rootwindow and defaultrootwindow;
code can include this header file first to run properly in the presence of a
virtual desktop.
subject: 147) how do i keep a window from being resized by the user?
resizing the window is done through the window manager; window managers
can pay attention to the size hints your application places on the window, but
there is no guarantee that the window manager will listen. you can try setting
the minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best. 1 91 subject: 148) how do i keep a window in the foreground at all times?
it's rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself e.g. by tracking visibilitynotify events so that it isn't overlapped --
imagine the conflict between two such programs running.
the only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack
is to make the window override-redirect; this means that you are temporarily
assuming window-management duties while the window is up, so you want to do
this infrequently and then only for short periods of time (e.g. for popup
menus or other short parameter-setting windows). thanks to der mouse 7 92 subject: 149) how do i make text and bitmaps blink in x?
there is no easy way. unless you're willing to depend on some sort of
extension (as yet non-existent), you have to arrange for the blinking yourself,
either by redrawing the contents periodically or, if possible, by playing games
with the colormap and changing the color of the contents. thanks to (der mouse), 7 91 subject: 150) how do i get a double-click in xlib?
users of xt have the support of the translation manager to help
get notification of double-clicking.
there is no good way to get only a double-click in xlib, because the
protocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks. you have to do
client-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can defer
actually taking it until you next see an event from the server. thus, you
have to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code. on most unixish
implementations, you can use xconnectionnumber to get the file descriptor of
the x connection and then use select() or something similar on that.
note that many user-interface references suggest that a double-click
be used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the case
in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise
check the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, should
be the single-click action or the double-click action. thanks to (der mouse), 4 93 subject: 151)! how do i render rotated text?
xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics
capabilities, leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphics
libraries.
your only choice, if you want to stay within the core x protocol, is to
render the text into a pixmap, read it back via xgetimage(), rotate it ""by
hand"" with whatever matrices you want, and put it back to the server via
xputimage(); more specifically:
1) create a bitmap b and write your text to it.
2) create an xybitmap image i from b (via xgetimage).
3) create an xybitmap image i2 big enough to handle the transformation.
4) for each x,y in i2, i2(x,y) i(a,b) where
a x cos(theta) - y sin(theta)
b x sin(theta) y cos(theta)
5) render i2
note that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose
bits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better.
the high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for x
also permit rendering of rotated text: display postscript, pex, phigs, and gks,
although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the
same fonts that would be found on a printer.
in addition, if you have enough access to the server to install a font
on it, you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some
predefined angle. your application can then itself figure out placement of each
glyph. courtesy der mouse eric taylor and ken lee 11 90;
liam quin 12 90 interviews (c ui toolkit, in the x contrib software) has support for
rendering rotated fonts in x. it could be one source of example code. brian r. smith 3 91 another possibility is to use the hershey fonts; they are
stroke-rendered and can be used by x by converting them into xdrawline
requests. 10 91 the xrotfont program by alan richardson (posted to comp.sources.x july 14 1992) paints a rotated font by implementing
the method above and by using an outline (hershey) font.
the xvertext package by alan richardson is a
set of functions to facilitate the writing of text at any angle. version 3.0

subject: 152) what is the x registry? (how do i reserve names?)
there are places in the x toolkit, in applications, and in the x
protocol that define and use string names. the context is such that conflicts
are possible if different components use the same name for different things.

orgainization names, selection names, selection targets, resource types,
application classes, and class extension record types; and several others.

distinctive -- you need to know that it is an x11 connection."
66427.eml,comp.windows.x,"you wanna do masking. build a bitmap (pixmap of depth one) where all pixels
you name ""opaque"" are 1 (that get copied) and the others are 0. use this
bitmap as the clip mask in the gc used for xcopyarea(), and remember to
adjust the clip origin coordinates to the xcopyarea() blit origin.
the mouse pointer (besides from that it is driven using ramdac analog
mapping on most hardwares) uses a mask, too.
but be warned: blitting through a mask and especially moving around this mask
is annoying slow on most xservers... it flickers even at 40 mips... -o- -------------------------------------------------------------- -o- -o- -------------------------------------------------------------- -o-"
66428.eml,comp.windows.x,"no. as soon as you blit two of this icons once on top of the other with a
little dislocation, you see the rectangular blit crashes too much of the
icon first blitted, because it draws a full rectangle. the way to do it
is masking: create a bitmap with all pixels to be merged are 1 and all
not to be merged are 0. then, set the clip mask of the gc to this
bitmap, set the clip x origin and clip y origin of the gc to the x y
coordinates where you blit the icon to the destination drawable, use gxcopy,
and xcopyarea() the icon pixmap to the destination drawable using this gc. -o- -------------------------------------------------------------- -o- -o- -------------------------------------------------------------- -o-"

subject: 4) what x-related public mailing lists are available?
the xpert mailing list is the general, public mailing list on x
maintained by the x consortium. the mailings are gatewayed, so xpert is almost
identical to the comp.windows.x usenet newsgroup. if you get comp.windows.x, you don't need to be added to the xpert mailing list. otherwise, you can join the list to receive x information
electronically. it is best to find a local distribution; perhaps someone within
your company is already receiving the mailing. as a last resort, send mail to with a valid return electronic address.
the xannounce mailing list carries major x announcements, such as new
releases (including public patches from mit), public reviews, adoption of
standards by the mit x consortium, and conference announcements. it does not
carry advertisements, source code, patches, or questions. if you already
receive the usenet news group comp.windows.x.announce or the xpert mailing
list, you don't need to be added to the xannounce mailing list. otherwise, to
subscribe, send a request to note: only
redistribution addresses will be accepted for this list -- i.e. no personal
addresses. if you wish to receive xannounce yourself, please contact your mail
administrator to set up a local redistribution list and to put you on it.
comp.windows.x.apps is not gatewayed to a mailing list.
in addition, the x consortium sponsors these public lists:
bug-clx clx bug reports and discussions
x-ada x and ada
x11-3d people interested in x and 3d graphics
ximage people interested in image processing and x
xvideo discussion of video extensions for x
to subscribe to one of these lists, assuming no-one in your
organization already receives it, send mail to with the subject line including the name of the list in caps and the request
""addition request"". in the body of the message be sure to give an address for
your local distribution which is accessible from mit (eddie.mit.edu).
a mailing list for topics related to open look is sponsored by greg
pasquariello of unify corporation; send to (or for information.
a mailing list for bugs in the publicly-available version of xview
source, in particular, is sponsored by sun; send for information to a mailing list for topics related to motif is sponsored by kee hinckley
of alfalfa software, inc.; send to for information.
(this group is gatewayed to comp.windows.x.motif.)
a mailing list for topics related to the xpm pixmap-format is sponsored
by arnaud le hors of group bull; send to for
information. 1 91 a mailing list discussing interviews can be subscribed to by sending to a mailing list for topics related to the port
of x11 to the amiga can be subscribed by sending to a
message containing
subject: adding myself to amiga-x11
subs amiga-x11 your real name

subject: 7) how do i ask a net-question so as to maximize helpful responses?
when asking for help on the net or x mailing lists, be sure to include
all information about your setup and what you are doing. the more specific you
are, the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing. without
all the details, people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they are
able to respond at all.
always mention what version of x you are using and where you got it
from. if your server came from a different source as the rest of your x system,
give details of that, too. give the machine type, operating system, and o s
version for both the client and server machine. it may also be appropriate to
mention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are using.
then tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and what
you expected wanted to happen. if it is a command that fails, include the
exact transcript of your session in the message. if a program you wrote
doesn't work the way you expect, include as little of the source necessary
(just a small test case, please!) for readers to reproduce the problem.
subject: 8) what publications discussing x are available?

subject: 10) what is the icccm? (how do i write x-friendly applications?)
the inter-client communication conventions manual is one of the
official x consortium standards documents that define the x environment. it
describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with
other clients sharing the same server. if you are writing x clients, you need
to read and understand the icccm, in particular the sections discussing the
selection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window
manager. get it either:
- as part of the r4 distribution from mit
- in the later editions of the scheifler gettys ""x window system"" book
- as an appendix in the new version of o'reilly's volume 0, ""x protocol
reference manual."" a version in old copies of their volume 1 is obsolete.
the version in the digital press book is much more readable, thanks to
the efforts of digital press's editors to improve the english and the
presentation. from david rosenthal, 10 90 - the icccm was updated for r5; updates are published in o'reilly's
""programmer's supplement for release 5"". the complete document is on the r5
tapes.
alternate definition: the icccm is generally the m in ""rtfm"" and is
the most-important of the least-read x documents.
subject: 11) what is the x consortium, and how do i join?
the mit x consortium was formed in january of 1988 to further the
development of the x window system and has as its major goal the promotion of
cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software
interfaces at all layers in the x window system environment.
mit's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and
administrative leadership required to make this work. membership in the
consortium open to any organization. there are two categories of membership,
member (for large organizations) and affiliate (for smaller organizations).
most of the consortium's activities take place via electronic mail,
with meetings when required. as designs and specifications take shape,
interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.
typically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with
others acting as close observers and reviewers. once a complete specification
is produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the consortium
as a proposed standard. the standards process typically includes public
review (outside the consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept.
your involvement in the public review process or as a member or
affiliate of the consortium is welcomed.

science, 545 technology square, cambridge, ma 02139. for complete information see the xconsortium man page from the x11r4
distribution, from which this information is adapted. 2 90 subject: 12) just what are open look and motif?
open look and motif are two graphical user interfaces (guis). open look
was developed by sun with help from at t and many industry reviewers; motif was
developed by the open software foundation (osf) with input from many osf
members.
open look is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide;
there are several toolkits which can be used to produce open look applications.
motif includes an api specification; the only sanctioned motif toolkit is the
one from osf. however, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce
programs which look and behave like osf motif; one of these, parcplace's
(formerly solbourne's) oi, is a ""virtual toolkit"" which provides objects in the
style of open look and motif, at the user's choice.
open look gui is also the name of a product from at t, comprising
their open look intrinsics toolkit and a variety of applications. thanks to ian darwin, 5 91 subject: 13) just what is openwindows?
open windows (3.0) is a sun product that encompasses: a window system
that combines a news and x11-compliant server (x news); a user-interface
specification (open look) and a series of toolkits that implement it (including
the sunview-like xview and the xt-based olit); xlib and xt implementations; and
a number of utilities (olwm window manager, filemgr, shelltool, etc.). thanks to frank greco 8 90; 4 92 subject: 14) just what is decwindows?
decwindows is a dec product that encompasses: an x11 server; the xui
toolkit, including the dwt widget set and uil; xlib and xt implementations; a
session manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar,
dxpsview, etc.).
(at some point motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.) 8 90 subject: 15) what is pex?
pex is the ""phigs extension to x"".
phigs stands for ""programmer's hierarchical interactive graphics
system"" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation
and manipulation of 3d graphics. many platforms are capable of performing in
hardware the computations involved in rendering 3d objects; the extension
allows the client (phigs in this case) to take advantage of the specialized
hardware for 3d graphics.
sun microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely
redistributable (copyright similar to the current x copyright) sample
implementation. source and documentation are available in the r5 release.
several vendors are currently selling independently-developed pex servers for
their workstations and x terminals. last modified 10 91 subject: 16) what is ""low-bandwidth x"" (lbx)? xremote? ppp? slip? cslip?
there are several options for using x over serial lines:
slip - serial line ip; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending ip
packets over point-to-point serial links. it has been around for several years,
and implementations are available for many of the major tcp ip implementations.
most x terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really
ever uses it since it is horribly slow. the tcp ip headers add 40 bytes per
packet and the tcp ip encoding of the x protocol is rather verbose (rightfully
so; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links).
cslip - compressed header slip; this is a variant of slip that compresses the
40 bytes of tcp ip headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes. it still doesn't do
anything about reencoding the x protocol. modems that do compression can help,
but they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed
data through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).
ppp - point-to-point protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point
links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than
slip. a growing number of people see the combination of ppp for the serial
line management and cslip for the header compression as becoming common for
running normal tcp ip protocols over serial lines. running raw x over the wire
still needs compression somewhere to make it usable.
xremote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally
developed by ncd for squeezing the x protocol over serial lines. in addition
to using a low level transport mechanism similar to ppp cslip, xremote removes
redundancies in the x protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and
using lzw to compress the entire data stream. this work is done by either a
pseudo-x server or ""proxy"" running on the host or in a terminal server. there
are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:
(1)	you don't have to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't
otherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly
connected), and
(2)	it reduces the i o overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that
have to cross the serial interface, and
(3)	in addition to the effects of 2, it reduces the latency in delivering
packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for
blocks to compress.
lbx - low bandwidth x; this is an x consortium project that is working on a
standard for this area. it is being chaired by ncd and xerox and is using
ncd's xremote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol. lbx
will go beyond xremote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information
(e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps,
etc.) and a more efficient encoding of the x protocol. the hope is to have a
standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample
implementation available in r6.
additional technical information about how xremote works and a few notes on how
lbx might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu

subject: 17) topic: using x in day-to-day life
subject: 18)! what are all these different window managers?
the window manager in x is just another client -- it is not part of the
x window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is
no single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways
for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout,
decoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. in approximate chronological order
(generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the icccm):
wm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in r2 or r3
uwm: the universal window manager is still popular for its speed,
although it is very outdated. moved to contrib on the r4 tape.
twm (old): tom's window manager was among the first non-mit window
managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a
re-parenting window manager.
awm: the ardent window manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers
some features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers
cwm: cwm is part of the andrew system.
rtl: siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap
and resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size.
dxwm: digital's dxwm is part of the decwindows offering
hpwm: hp's window manager offers a 3d look; it is a precursor of mwm
mwm: the motif window manager is part of the osf motif toolkit
tekwm: tektronix's window manager offering
olwm (sun): olwm implements the open look gui and some of the style
guide functionality
olwm (at t): ditto
gwm: bull's generic window manager emulates others with a built-in
lisp interpreter. version 1.7h (10 91) is on the r5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on
avahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. 3 93 m swm: the sigma window manager is on the r4 tape
pswm: sun's postscript-based pswm is part of the openwindows release
swm: solbourne's swm is based on the oi toolkit and offers multiple
gui support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes
from the resources file
twm (new): mit's new tab window manager from the r4 tape is a reworked
twm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the r5 tape
vtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a
single-root window implementation; it is based on the r4 twm and is available
on archive servers. a new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on r5.9 and is available
from export. 3 92 tvtwm: tom's virtual tab window manager is also based on the r4 twm
and provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. it is
available on archive servers
olvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to sun's olwm. it is
available on archive servers; version 3.3 1 93 is on export.
mvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to osf's mwm. a beta version
is floating around (most recently from but requires a
source license to osf motif 1.1.3 3 92 .
ncdwm: the window manager local to ncd terminals offers an mwm look
xdswm: the window manager local to visual technology's terminals
ctwm: claude lecommandeur's modification of the r5
twm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of hp vuewm; source is on export.
version 2.2.2 2 93 also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm.
vuewm: hp's mwm-based window manager offers configurable workspaces.
4dwm: sgi's enhanced mwm
piewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus
subject: 19) why does my x session exit when i kill my window manager (sic)?
it needn't. what is probably happening is that you are running your
window manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your x
session runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your
window manager is equivalent to logging out. instead, run the window manager in
the background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like:
exec xterm -name login -rv -iconic
or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action.
your x session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window,
whether or not you kill or restart your window manager.
subject: 20) can i save the state of my x session, like toolplaces does?
although no known window manager directly supports such a feature --
which may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the
geometry and wm command of each application (but olvwm may have something
close) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are
looking for, although it is not as complete as the sunview program toolplaces.
look for the application ""xplaces"" on an archive-server near you. there are
several versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage. 10 90 some new pseudo session-managers such as hp's vuewm provide for the
saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running
applications and the resource database. bjxrn stabell 3 93. subject: 21) how do i use another window manager with dec's session manager?
dec's session manager will start dxwm up by default. to override this,
add to your .xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname:
sm.windowmanagername: wherever usr bin x11 your favorite wm
subject: 22) how do i change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?
you can turn auto-repeat on or off by using ""xset r on off"". the x
protocol, however, doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is
a capability not supported by all systems.
some servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide
command-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. if you have control over
server start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the
server with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the xsun server
from mit with the options ""-ar1 350 -ar2 30"" to reduce the sensitivity of the
keyboard.
subject: 23) how do i remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?
there is no method of arranging for a particular string to be
produced when you press a particular key. the xmodmap client, which is useful
for moving your ctrl and esc keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and
does not do ""macro expansion.""
some (few) clients, including xterm and several x-based editors,
accept a translation resource such as:
xterm vt100.translations: override f1: string(""setenv display unix:0"")
which permits the shorthand f1 to be pressed to reset the display locally
within an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. to include control
characters in the string, use nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the
control character you want to include.
window managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor
has a special ""remapper"" client been made available.

66430.eml,comp.windows.x,"subject: 24)! how do i make a screendump or print my application?
the xwd client in the x11 distributions can be used to select a window
or the background. it produces an xwd-format file of the image of that window.
the file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr
client and your local printing mechanism. you can use this command:
csh sleep 10; xwd -root output.xwd and then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current
display will be saved into the file output.xwd. note that xwd also has an
undocumented (before r5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the
command-line. there are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for
specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture. two publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of
arbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc.
there are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2, available on export 8 92 is the most recent.
xsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders
xpm output version unknown . it is available on export or avahi.inria.fr;
see xsnap-pl2.tar.z.
a screen-dump and merge edit program combining features of xwd and xpr
is available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.z. information: xprint, by alberto accomazzi is available
from cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.z.
to post-process the xwd output of some of these tools, you can use xpr,
which is part of the x11 distribution. also on several archives are xwd2ps
and xtops, which produce encapsulated postscript with trimmings suitable for
use in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib xwd2ps.tar.z and
contrib imagemagick.tar.z). also useful is the pbmplus package on many archive
servers; and the xim package contains level 2 color postscript output.
the xv program can grab a portion of the x display, manipulate it, and
save it in one of the available formats. imagemagick has similar capabilities.
also:
bristol technology 203-438-6969) offers xprinter
2.0, an xlib api for postscript and pcl printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.net
in vendor bristol xprinter.
colorsoft 9619-459-8500) offers openprint package includes a screen-
capture facility, image-processing, and support for postscript and
non-postscript printers.
some vendors' implementations of x (e.g. decwindows and openwindows)
include session managers or other desktop programs which include ""print portion
of screen"" or ""take a snapshot"" options. some platforms also have tools which
can be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the sun systems, for example,
have a 'screendump' program which produces a sun raster file. some x terminals
have local screen-dump utilities to write postscript to a local serial printer.
some vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. sony) include direct
support for printing xwd files, but you'll typically need some other package
to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.
subject: 25) how do i make a color postscript screendump of the x display?
if you need color postscript in particular, you can
- grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color
postscript, such as xgrabsc and xv
- grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color ps.
you can do this using xwd2ps or the xtops program from the imagemagick
distribution. the pbmplus package is also good for this, as is the xim package.
subject: 26) how do i make a screendump including the x cursor?
this can't be done unless the x server has been extended. consider
instead a system-dependent mechanism for, e.g., capturing the frame-buffer.
subject: 27) how do i convert view mac tiff gif sun pict img fax images in x?
the likeliest program is an incarnation of jef poskanzer's useful portable bitmap toolkit, which includes a number of programs for converting
among various image formats. it includes support for many types of bitmaps,
gray-scale images, and full-color images. pbmplus has been updated recently;
the most recent version 12 91 is on export in contrib pbmplus10dec91.tar.z.
another tool is san diego supercomputing center's imtools ('imconv' in
particular), which packages the functionality of pbm into a single binary.
it's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).
useful for viewing some image-formats is jim frost's xloadimage, a
version of which is in the r4 directory contrib clients xloadimage; there are
later versions available, including contrib xloadimage.3.03.tar.z on export.
graeme gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export;
see xli.readme and xli.tar.z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2 93.
xv (x image viewer), written by (john bradley),
can read and display pictures in sun raster, pgm, pbm, ppm, x11 bitmap, tiff,
gif and jpeg. it can manipulate on the images: adjust, color, intensity,
contrast, aspect ratio, crop). it can save images in all of the aforementioned
formats plus postscript. it can grab a portion of the x display, manipulate on
it, and save it in one of the available formats. the program was updated 5 92;
see the file contrib xv-2.21.tar.z on export.lcs.mit.edu.
the fuzzy pixmap manipulation, by michael mauldin conversion and manipulation package, similar to pbmplus. version 1.0 available
via ftp as nl.cs.cmu.edu: usr mlm ftp fbm.tar.z, uunet.uu.net:pub fbm.tar.z,
and ucsd.edu:graphics fbm.tar.z.
the img software set, by paul raveling reads
and writes its own image format, displays on an x11 screen, and does some image
manipulations. version 1.3 is available via ftp on expo.lcs.mit.edu as
contrib img 1.3.tar.z, along with large collection of color images.
the utah rle toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar
to pbmplus. available via ftp as cs.utah.edu:pub urt- ,
weedeater.math.yale.edu:pub urt- , and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub urt- .
xim, the x image manipulator, by philip thompson, does essential
interactive displaying, editing, filtering, and converting of images. there is
a version in the x11r4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using r4 and
motif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). xim reads writes gif,
xwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a
library and command-line utilities for building your own applications.
imagemagick 2.3; 2 93 by can be retrieved from
export's contrib area. it is a collection of utilities to transform and display
images on any x server. the tool uses the miff format; filters to and from miff
from other popular formats (ppm, tiff, gif, sun raster, etc) are included.
xtiff is a tool for viewing a tiff file in an x window. it was written
to handle as many different kinds of tiff files as possible while remaining
simple, portable and efficient. xtiff illustrates some common problems
with building pixmaps and using different visual classes. it is distributed
as part of sam leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on
export.lcs.mit.edu, uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x. xtiff 2.0 was announced in 4 91; it includes xlib and xt versions.
a version of lee iverson's image-viewing tool
is available as contrib vimage-0.9.3.tar.z on export.lcs.mit.edu. the package
also includes an imageviewport widget and a filedialog widget. 12 91;5 92 some material from larry carroll 5 91 subject: 28) how can i change the titlebar of my xterm window?
the solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will
cause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the
string which appears in the window titlebar.
a solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell:
echo ""esc 2;text g""
where esc is the escape key, text is the string you wish to have displayed,
and g is a control-g (the bel character).
here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to
the current working directory when you change directories:
alias newcd 'cd ! ; echo -n esc 2 ; cwd g'
the digit '2' in these strings indicates to xterm that it should
change only the title of the window; to change both the title and the name
used in the icon, use the digit '0' instead, and use '1' to change only the
icon name.
note: another way to do this, which prevents an incorrect display of
the local directory if a modified cd is used in a subshell, is to wrap the
escape sequences into the ps1 prompt itself.
note: on an ibm rs 6000 is may be necessary to begin the sequence with
a v.
subject: 29) where can i find the xterm control sequences?
the best source of such information is in your r5 sources in the file
ctlseqs.ms; a postscript version is in mit hardcopy clients ctlseqs.ps.z.
o'reilly's volume 3, the x user's guide, includes an r5 version of the control
sequences; the standard volume will be available 3 93, and a motif version of
the book is available now. the current (r4) guide includes an outdated version
of the control sequences. 1 93 other good sources of information include the r4 version of that document
and also the file in the r4 sources called mit clients xterm ctlseq2.txt, a
compilation put together by skip montanaro (ge cr d) listing the vt100
sequences. it dates from r3 but is fairly accurate. a hardcopy version was
published in the december 1989 xnextevent (the xug newsletter).
in a pinch, a vt100 manual will do. last updated 10 91 subject: 30)- why does the r3 xterm, et al, fail against the r4 server?
subject: 31) how can i use characters above ascii 127 in xterm ?
in order to use special characters such as the o-umlaut, you need to
""stty pass8"" but also to use a charcell iso8859 font, such as
xterm font: - - -medium-r-normal- - -130- - -c- -iso8859-1
xterm boldfont:	- - -bold-r-normal- - -130- - -c- -iso8859-1 the family is intentionally unspecified in this example. in addition, you may want to set this in your shell:
setenv lc ctype iso 8859 1
for a given character above 127, you can determine the key to use with
the alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 (try using man ascii ). for example, o-umlaut (v) is alt-v and the section character (')
is alt-'. thanks to greg holmberg and stephen gildea 6 92 subject: 32) why are my xterm menus so small?
you are probably setting the geometry small accidentally. if you give
a resource specification like this:
xterm geometry: 80x24
then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to
80x24. for the main window, this is ok, as it uses characters for its size.
but its popup menus don't; they are in pixels and show up small. to set only
the terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it explicitly:
xterm vt100.geometry: 80x24
subject: 33) how can i print the current selection?
you could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command.
however, a program by richard hesketh specifically for
manipulating the selection will help; e.g. xselection primary lpr
finds the primary selection and prints it. this command can be placed in a
window-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of
the selection and other properties. a version is on export.
also available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub xget selection.tar.z, which can be
adapted to do this.
subject: 34) how does xt use environment variables in loading resources?
you can use several environment variables to control how resources are
loaded for your xt-based programs -- xfilesearchpath, xuserfilesearchpath, and
xapplresdir. these environment variables control where xt looks for
application-defaults files as an application is initializing. xt loads at most
one app-defaults file from the path defined in xfilesearchpath and another from
the path defined in xuserfilesearchpath.
set xfilesearchpath if software is installed on your system in such a
way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.
suppose, for example, that you are running sun's open windows, and you also
have some r4 x applications installed in usr lib x11 app-defaults. you could
set a value like this for xfilesearchpath, and it would cause xt to look up
app-defaults files in both usr lib x11 and usr openwin lib (or wherever your
openwinhome is located):
setenv xfilesearchpath usr lib x11 t n: openwinhome lib t n
the value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames. the pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see
xtresolvepathname()): n the value of the filename parameter, or the
application's class name. t the value of the file ""type"". in this case, the
literal string ""app-defaults"" c customization resource (r5 only) s suffix. none for app-defaults. l language, locale, and codeset (e.g. ""ja jp.euc"") l language part of l (e.g. ""ja"") t the territory part of the display's language string c the codeset part of the display's language string
let's take apart the example. suppose the application's class name is
""myterm"". also, suppose open windows is installed in usr openwin. (notice the
example omits locale-specific lookup.) usr lib x11 t n means usr lib x11 app-defaults myterm openwinhome lib t n means usr openwin lib app-defaults myterm
as the application initializes, xt tries to open both of the above
app-defaults files, in the order shown. as soon as it finds one, it reads it
and uses it, and stops looking for others. the effect of this path is to
search first in usr lib x11, then in usr openwin.
let's consider another example. this time, let's set
xuserfilesearchpath so it looks for the file myterm.ad in the current working
directory, then for myterm in the directory app-defaults.
setenv xuserfilesearchpath . n.ad: home app-defaults n
the first path in the list expands to . myterm.ad. the second expands
to home app-defaults myterm. this is a convenient setting for debugging
because it follows the imake convention of naming the app-defaults file
myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application
from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded
properly. note: when looking for app-default files with xuserfilesearchpath,
for some bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so t and s are useless.
with r5, there's another twist. you may specify a customization
resource value. for example, you might run the ""myterm"" application like this:
myterm -xrm "" customization: -color""
if one of your pathname specifications had the value
"" usr lib x11 t n c"" then the expanded pathname would be
"" usr lib x11 app-defaults myterm-color"" because the c substitution character
takes on the value of the customization resource.
the default xfilesearchpath, compiled into xt, is: usr lib x11 l t n c: (r5) usr lib x11 l t n c: (r5) usr lib x11 t n c: (r5) usr lib x11 l t n: usr lib x11 l t n: usr lib x11 t n
(note: some sites replace usr lib x11 with a projectroot in
this batch of default settings.)
the default xuserfilesearchpath, also compiled into xt, is l n c: (r5) l n c: (r5) n c: (r5) l n: l n: n: is either the value of xapplresdir or the user's home directory
if xapplresdir is not set. if you set xuserfilesearchpath to some value other
than the default, xt ignores xapplresdir altogether.
notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find
your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set xapplresdir
to ""."", a single dot. in r3, all this machinery worked differently; for r3
compatibilty, many people set their xapplresdir value to "". "", a dot followed
by a slash. thanks to oliver jones 2 93. subject: 35) how to i have the r4 xdm put a picture behind the log-in window?
the answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a
program to change the background before loading the resources; for example,
your usr lib x11 xdm xdm-config file may add the line
displaymanager.0.authorize: false
to permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also
displaymanager xrdb: usr lib x11 xdm new.xrdb
where that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of: ! bin sh comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load usr lib x11 xdm xresources usr bin x11 xsetroot -display 2 -bitmap usr lib x11 xdm new.bitmap usr bin x11 xrdb substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste. note that this is a
general hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client. thanks to jay bourland 9 91 subject: 36) why isn't my path set when xdm runs my .xsession file?
when xdm runs your .xsession it doesn't source your .cshrc or .login
files. you can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any sh script;
or you can place all environment-setting statements in a separate file and
source it from both the .xsession file and your shell configuration file; or,
if you set your path in your .cshrc file, the normal place, you can make your
.xsession have path set simply by making it a csh script, i.e. by starting
your .xsession file off with "" ! bin csh"".
if this doesn't work, also try starting off with: ! bin sh reset path:
path csh -c 'echo path' ; export path
subject: 37) how do i keep my display when i rlogin to another machine?
there are several ways to avoid having to do a ""setenv display ...""
whenever you log in to another networked unix machine running x.
one solution is to use the clients xrsh on the r5 contrib tape. it
includes xrsh, a script to start an x application on remote machine, and
xrlogin, a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine.
a more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar.
one solution is to use the xrlogin program from der mouse you can ftp caveat-emptor versions from
132.206.1.1, in x xrlogin.c and x xrlogind.c. the program packages up term and display into a single string, which is stuffed into term. rlogin then
propagates term normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain
eval xrlogind where xrlogind is a program that checks term and if it is of the special
format it recognizes, unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to
recreate the environment variables. 11 90 in addition, if all you need to do is start a remote x process on
another host, and you find
rsh -n usr bin x11 xterm -display display
too simple (display must have your real hostname), then this version of xrsh
can be used to start up remote x processes. the equivalent usage would be
xrsh xterm ! bin sh start an x11 process on another host date: 8 dec 88 06:29:34 gmt from: chris torek rsh host -n ""setenv display display; exec dev null"" an improved version: rxcmd (suggested by john robinson, (generalized for sh,ksh by keith boyer, but they put the rcmd in ()'s which left zombies again. this script combines the best of both.

subject: 38) how can i design my own font?
one way is to use the ""bitmap"" client or some other bitmap-editor (e.g.
sun's icon-editor tool, post-processed with pbmplus) to design the individual
characters and then to do some large amount of post-processing to concatenate
them into the bdf format. see ollie jones's article in the november 91 x
journal for more information.
the r3 contrib area (in fonts utils and in clients xtroff) contained
a number of useful utilities, including some to convert between bdf font format
and a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor.
an easier way is to use the ""xfed"" client to modify an existing font; a
version is on the r4 or r5 x11r5 contrib tape in contrib clients xfed. xfed is
available for anonymous ftp on ftp.informatik.uni-dortmund.de 129.217.64.63 ,
possibly as file pub windows x diverse-x11-sourcen xfed.tar.z. it can produce
bdf-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of x servers.
the xfedor client from group bull permits creation of bitmaps, cursors,
xpm1 pixmaps, and fonts. binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in pub; in addition, the sources (an old xlib implementation) have been placed 5 91 in export: contrib.
if you are a metafont user you can use ""mftobdf"" from the seetex
distribution to convert pk, gf, and pxl fonts to bdf format; the distribution
is on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu.
the gnu package fontutils-0.4.tar.z on prep.ai.mit.edu includes xbfe,
a font editor, and a number of utilities for massaging font formats.
the o'reilly x resource issue 2 contains an article on using these
tools to modify a font.
fonts can be resized with hiroto kagotani's bdfresize; a new version is
in ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp: x11 contrib.
subject: 39) why does adding a font to the server not work (sic)?
after you have built the font using your system's font-compiler,
installed it in some directory, and run mkfontdir or your system's equivalent
(e.g. bldfamily for openwindows) in that directory, be sure to use xset fp dir to add that full path-name to the server's font-path, or if the
directory is already in the path, use xset fp rehash so that the new fonts in
that directory are actually found; it is this last step that you're probably
leaving out. (you can also use xset q to make sure that that directory is in
the path.)
sometimes your ""xset fp dir"" command fails with a badvalue error:
x error of failed request:badvalue
(integer parameter out of range for operation)
major opcode of failed request: 51 (x setfontpath)
this means the x server cannot find or read your font directory, or
that your directory does not look like a font directory to the server. (the
mention of an ""integer parameter"" in the message is spurious.)
system? remember, it's the server, not the client, which interprets your
font directory. trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an
xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. ""xset fp myfonts"") and
the server is an x terminal or managed by xdm.
(or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file
""fonts.dir"". if you can't find that file, run mkfontdir(1). (if you're
running openwindows, look for the file ""families.list"". if you can't find
it, run bldfamily(1).)
proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (openwindows, for
example), make sure the font directory is right for the server you're using.
hint: if the directory contains .pcf and or .snf files, it won't work for
open windows. if the directory contains .ff and or .fb files, it won't work
for x11rn. thanks to der mouse and to oliver jones 7 92 subject: 40) how do i convert a "".snf"" font back to "".bdf"" font?
a tool called ""snftobdf 1.4"" is part of the bdftools package, which is
available from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib bdftools.tar.z and from
crl.nmsu.edu:pub misc bdftools.tar.z. 2 91 subject: 41) what is a general method of getting a font in usable format?
der mouse's getbdf is one solution; it connects to a server and
produces a .bdf file for any font the server is willing to let it. it can be
used as an anything-to-bdf converter, but requires access to a server that can
understand the font file, thus is both more and less powerful than other tools
such as snftobdf. getbdf is on 132.206.1.1 in x getbdf.c or available via mail
from 5 91 in addition, the r5 program ""fstobdf"" can produce bdf for any font that
the r5 server has access to.
subject: 42) how do i use decwindows fonts on my non-decwindows server?
the decwindows fonts typically don't exist on a non-dec installation,
but rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by decwindows applications to
standard mit fonts of similar characteristics and size. pick up the file
contrib decwindows on x11r4 font.aliases from export.lcs.mit.edu; this file is
for a standard mit r4 server. it can also serve as a starting point for
creating a similar aliases file for the open windows server or other servers
which do not use the mit font scheme.
subject: 43) how do i add "".bdf"" fonts to my decwindows server?
the format of fonts preferred by dec's x server is the "".pcf"" format.
you can produce this compiled format from the .bdf format by using dec's dxfc
font-compiler. note that the dec servers can also use raw .bdf fonts, with a
performance hit.
subject: 44)! how can i set backgroundpixmap in a defaults file? (what is xpm?)
i want to be able to do something like this:
xclock backgroundpixmap: usr include x11 bitmaps rootweave
you can't do this. the backgroundpixmap resource is a pixmap of the
same depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). because
of this, writing a generic string to pixmap converter is impossible, since
there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. therefore,
neither the x toolkit or the athena widget set define a string to pixmap
converter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a
resource. the athena widget set does define a string to bitmap converter for
use in many of its widgets, however. courtesy chris d. peterson (now 4 90 however:
a specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of
the xloadimage package by jim frost was posted 12 90 by sebastian wangnick it permits loading of a number of
image formats as a pixmap.
the leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the xpm format used
by groupe bull in several of its programs, including the gwm window manager, by
at t in its olpixmap editor, and by ics in its interface builder. xpm
distribution, available on export as contrib xpm.tar.z, includes read write
routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to
allow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner. see information
on the xpm-talk mailing list above. xpm 3.0f was announced in 3 93 and is
available from export.lcs.mit.edu and avahi.inria.fr; an older version is on
the r5 contrib tape. a set of xpm icons collected by anthony thyssen is on export in contrib aicons. subject: 45) why can't i override translations? only the first item works.
you probably have an extra space after the specification of the first
item, like this:
basic text.translations: override ctrl a: beginning-of-line() n ctrl e: end-of-line() extra space
the newline after that space is ending the translation definition. thanks to timothy j. horton, 5 91 subject: 46) how can i have xclock or oclock show different timezones?
one solution is xchron, in volume 6 of comp.sources.x, which can show
the time for timezones other than the local one.
alternatively, you can probably set the timezone in the shell from
which you invoke the xclock or oclock, or use a script similar to this: ! bin sh
tz pst8pdt xclock -name ""san luis obispo ca"" 2 dev null tz est5edt xclock -name ""king of prussia pa"" 2 dev null subject: 47) i have xmh, but it doesn't work. where can i get mh?
the xmh mail-reader requires the rand mh mail message handling system,
which is not part of the unix software distribution for many machines. a list
of various ftp, uucp, e-mail and us-mail sites for both xmh and mh is given in
the monthly mh faq; one source is ics.uci.edu in the file pub mh mh-6.7.tar.z.
if you do not receive the comp.mail.mh newsgroup or the mh-users mailing list,
you can request a copy of the faq, which also includes a section on xmh,
by sending mail to containing the request
""send usenet news.answers mh-faq"".
subject: 48) why am i suddenly unable to connect to my sun x server?
after a seemingly random amount of time after the x server has been started, no
other clients are able to connect to it.
the default cron cleanup jobs supplied by sun (for 4.0.3, at least)
delete ""old"" (unreferenced) files from tmp -- including tmp .x11-unix, which
contains the socket descriptor used by x. the solution is to add ""! -type s"" to
the find exclusion in the cron job. 10 90 subject: 49) why don't the r5 pex demos work on my mono screen?
the r5 sample server implementation works only on color screens, sorry.
subject: 50)! how do i get my sun type- 45 keyboard fully supported by xsun?
many users wants the num lock key to light the num lock led and have the
appropriate effect on the numeric keypad. the xsun server as distributed by mit
doesn't do this but there are two different patches available.
the first patch is written by jonathan lemon and fixes the num lock related
problems. it is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in the file
contrib xsun-r5.numlock patch.z .
the second is written by martin forssen and fixes the num lock and compose keys
and adds support for the different national keyboard layouts for type-4 and
type-5 keyboards. this patch is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in
contrib sunkbd1216-0314.tar.z or via email from thanks to martin forssen or 8 92 a set of patches by william bailey was posted to newsgroups
11 92 to provide support for the type-5 keyboard.
subject: 51) how do i report bugs in x?
generally, report bugs you find to the organization that supplied you
with the x window system. if you received the r5 source distribution directly
from mit, please read the file mit bug-report for instructions. look in
mit doc bugs bug-report in r4. thanks to stephen gildea 5 91; 12 91 subject: 52) why do i get ""warning: widget class version mismatch""?
this error, which typically goes on to say, ""widget 11004 vs.
intrinsics 11003"" indicates that the header files you included when building
your program didn't match the header files that the xt library you're linking
against was built with; check your -i include path and -l link-path to be sure.
however, the problem also occurs when linking against a version of the
x11r4 xt library before patch 10; the version number was wrong. some sun ow
systems, in particular, were shipped with the flawed version of the library,
and applications which link against the library typically give the warnings you
have seen.
subject: 53) where can i find a dictionary server for xwebster?
webster's still owns the copyright to the on-line copies of webster's
dictionary which are found at various (university) sites. after it became aware
that these sites were then acting as servers for other sites running xwebster
and gnuemacs-webster, it asked that server sites close off external access. the next machine apparently is also licensed to have the dictionary. a
webster daemon for next machines is available from iuvax.cs.indiana.edu
(129.79.254.192) in ""pub webster next-2.0"". unless you want to get a legal on-line copy yourself or can find a site
which can grant you access, you are probably out of luck.
however, if you are a legitimate site, you'll want to pick up the
latest xwebster, as-is on export:contrib xwebster.tar.z 10 91 ; the file
xwebster.readme includes discussions of the availability, illegality, and
non-availability of dictionary servers. courtesy (steve miller) and (niels
mayer) 11 90 subject: 54) topic: obtaining x and related software and hardware
subject: 55) is x public-domain software?
no. the x software is copyrighted by various institutions and is not
""public domain"", which has a specific legal meaning. however, the x
distribution is available for free and can be redistributed without fee.
contributed software, though, may be placed in the public domain by
individual authors.
subject: 56) how compatible are x11r3, r4, and r5? what changes are there?
the release notes for each mit release of x11 specify the changes from the
previous release. the x consortium tries very hard to maintain compatibility
across releases. in the few places where incompatible changes were necessary,
details are given in the release notes. each x11 distribution site on the
network also offers the release notes that go with the release they offer; the
file typically can be found at the top of the distribution tree. stephen gildea, 1 92 the comp.windows.x.intrinsics faq-xt lists xt differences among these versions.
subject: 57)! where can i get x11r5 (source and or binaries)?
information about mit's distribution of the sources on 6250bpi and qic-24 tape
and its distribution of hardcopy of the documents is available from
software center, technology licensing office, massachusetts institute of
technology, 28 carleton street, room e32-300, cambridge ma 02142-1324,
phone: 617-258-8330.
you will need about 100mb of disk space to hold all of core and 140mb to hold
the contrib software donated by individuals and companies.
please use a site that is close to you in the network.
note that the release notes are generally available separately in the same
directory; the notes list changes from previous versions of x and offer a
guide to the distribution.

having any luck with either the xtici editor from export.lcs.mit.edu or with
o'reilly's ftp-able example xcms from ftp.uu.net.
the o'reilly example fails for almost every set of inputs because
xcmstekhvcquerymaxv returns a smaller value than xcmstekhvcqueryminv does
(which makes no sense to me).
the xtici editor fails in xcmsstorecolors, apparently because the
mathematical manipulations of the color specs results in invalid values. so
you can't actually edit any colors.
we have x11 r5 patch level 22; 8-bit pseudocolor visual. i've poked around
in the xcms code in xlib, but without some understanding of the theory i have
no idea what's going wrong. can somebody confirm if either of the
above-mentioned programs work on their systems, or let me know if they fail
for you too? please include what hardware software patch levels you have.
any hints?

66433.eml,comp.windows.x,"subject: 58)! where can i get patches to x11r5?
the release of new public patches by the mit x consortium is announced
in the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup.
patches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other
sites from which x11 is available. they are now also distributed through the
newsgroup comp.sources.x. some source re-sellers may be including patches in
their source distributions of x11.
people without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. it now has
23 patches for x11r5 3 93 . send to the subject line
send fixes where is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch.
here are a few complications:
1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request ""5a"", ""5b"", ""5c"" and
""5d"" separately
2) the file sungx.uu, which was part of an earlier patch, was
re-released with patch 7 note: the file doesn't work with solaris 3) fix 8 is in two parts: ""8a"" and ""8b""
4) fix 13 is in three parts: ""13a"", ""13b"", and ""13c""
5) fix 16 is in two parts: ""16a"" and ""16b""
6) fix 18 replaces the r5fix-test1 for the x test suite, which
previously was optional
7) fix 19 also needs pexlib.tar.z, which you can obtain from xstuff
by asking for ""pexlib.uu. 1234 "".
8) fix 22 is in 9 parts, ""22a"" through ""22i""
subject: 59) what is the xstuff mail-archive?
the xstuff server is a mail-response program. that means that you mail
it a request, and it mails back the response.
any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. the
xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can
have several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help).
the xstuff server treats the ""subject:"" header line just like any other line
of the message.
the archives are organized into a series of directories and
subdirectories. each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an
index. the top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the
subdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it.
1) the command ""help"" or ""send help"" causes the server to send you a
more detailed version of this help file.
2) if your message contains a line whose first word is ""index"", then
the server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. if
there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then
the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index.
for example, you can say ""send index fixes"" (or ""index fixes""). a message that
requests an index cannot request data.
3) if your message contains a line whose first word is ""send"", then the
xstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. to name
an item, you give its directory and its name. for example
send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9
you may issue multiple send requests. the xstuff server contains many
safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large
amounts of data. the mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed
amount of data each day. if the work queue contains more requests than the
day's quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day.
whenever the mailer is run to send its day's quota, it sends the requests out
shortest-first.
4) some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting
return addresses. if you use such a mailer, you won't get any response. if
you happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like
path or
path bar!foo!frotz
in the body of your message, and the daemon will use it.
the xstuff server itself can be reached at if
your mailer deals in ""!"" notation, try sending to someplace !mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff. based on information from the mit x consortium, 8 89, 4 90. subject: 60)! where can i get x11r4 (source and binaries)?

subject: 61) where can i get osf motif?
you can obtain either osf motif source or binaries from a number of
vendors.
motif 1.2.2 source is now available; it is based on x11r5.
motif 1.1 is based on the r4.18 intrinsics and is currently 7 92 at
1.1.5.
an osf motif source license must be obtained from osf before source can
be obtained from the open software foundation or any value-added vendor for
any version. call the direct channels desk at osf at 617-621-7300 for ordering
information.
various hardware vendors produce developer's toolkits of binaries,
header files, and documentation; check your hardware vendor, particularly if
that vendor is an osf member.
in addition, independent binary vendors produce motif toolkits for
machines for which motif is not supported by a vendor; the kits include varied
levels of bug-fixing and support for shared libraries and are based on widely
divergent version of motif:
quest (408-988-8880) sells kits for suns, as well;
ixi ( 44 223 462 131) offers kits for sun3 and sun4.
nsl ( 33 (1) 43 36 77 50; offers kits for the sun 3
and sun 4.
bluestone consulting makes a kit for sun systems.
ics (617-62-0060) makes several binary kits, notably for sun, dec.
hp and dec have announced support for motif on sun systems.
unipalm ( 44-954-211-797) currently offers for sun systems a motif
development kit including x11r4 and based on motif 1.1.2. the us distributor is
expert object corp (708-926-8500).
bim ships motif 1.1 binaries for suns. shared library support is
included. contact alain vermeiren or danny backx at 32(2)759.59.25 (fax : 32(2)759.47.95) (belgium).
silogic ( 33 61.57.95.95) ships motif 1.2 and motif 1.1 on sun
machines.
s.i. systems offers motif 1.2 for solaris 2.1; info: 1-800-755-8649 in
usa and canada.

implementation of x11r4 and motif 1.1.2 (including a shared-library
implementation of libxm.a) for the 386 486 unix market. motif 1.1.2 is
also available for sun sparc based workstations. it has also announced
motif 1.2 for solaris systems.
subject: 62) does motif work with x11r4? x11r5?
motif 1.2 is based on x11r5.
motif 1.1, available in source form from osf as of august 1990, uses
the ""vanilla"" x11r4 intrinsics, where ""vanilla"" means ""with just a few
patches""; the file fix-osf which osf distributes is obsoleted by mit's patches
15-17. the file fix-osf-1.1.1 distributed with the 1.1.1 version or its
subsequent modification needs to be applied after mit fix-18, though.
motif 1.1.1 to 1.1.3 will work with x11r5 if x11r5 is compiled with
-dmotifbc; 1.1.4 and later should work with the vanilla r5, although there are
some known new geometry-management problems.
subject: 63) where can i get toolkits implementing open look?
sun's xview has a sunview-style api. a version is on the x11r4 tape;
the latest 2 92 3.0 sources are on export in contrib xview3 .
xview and x binaries for the sun 386i (""roadrunner"") are available for
ftp from svin01.win.tue.nl (131.155.70.70), directory pub x11r4 386i.

66434.eml,comp.windows.x,"try the 'm.sc. computing science' course at the real newcastle university.
it's a conversion course, but at least they teach real programming.
in the space of 9 months we were taught pascal, simula, prolog, miranda.
also, some basic low level stuff (68000) was covered as well.
they also did concurrent programming and operating systems, some software
engineering, plus quite a few optional units, including database theory,
and some stuff about comms.
the pascal is to be replaced by c c i think next year - i learn't this (and
x windows programming as well)
anyway via a good selection of project over the final three months - depending
on your tastes, the selection of skills learn't can be quite wide reaching.
the one critiscism i would level at the course, which i would have thought
invaluable, is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry -
this would probably need a slightly longer project period (say six months), but
would enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough
course.
yes, i know this sounds like a plug for the course, why not!

66440.eml,comp.windows.x,"jan on a related note, how can i use xv to display colored gifs on my
jan root display with hp vue?
jan all i can do with vue is display xbm's through their
jan backdrop style manager.
jan xv does not seem to be able to override whatever vue
jan puts there.
i suspect this is because vue creates a window (probably overrideredirect)
that is the size of (or larger than) the root window. because the window
manager does not know about this, you cannot move, resize etc. it. xv in the
mean time is busy changing your root window to whatever you have requested
but you never get to see it because vue's window is overlaid on top of the root
window.
contact hp support and see whether vue can support coloured bitmap format
such as xpm, if they cant then they probably create all their coloured
backdrops inside the code.

sug cd 1992.1 is x11r5 and gnu on a cdrom, priced at 50 to sug
members, including a caddy!
sug's emphasis has always been on supplying the greatest possible
service and value-added to our members. last year, the sug 1991 disk
contained plug-and-play x11r4, 20mb of additional essential binaries,
almost 200mb of sun patches, fully-indexed archives of sun-related net
postings, priced at only 250.
our aim this year has been to reduce the price for disks which can be
produced inexpensively, but to continue to supply as much value-added
as possible. to accomplish this, we will be putting out a two disk
set, the first containing what's ready and needed now, the second
available later in '92, containing more sparc binaries and other
useful material not found on previous disks.
the sug 1992.1 disk, which was assembled by robert a. bruce, contains
a lot of essential source code, and we decided it would be a great
service to make it available right away to our members (and this
pricing makes this a good opportunity to become a member!) for 50 per
disk (including one of those hard-to-find caddies!). if you are not a
sug member, you can become one for an additional 40 if you live
within the us or 55 outside.
the sug 1992.1 cdrom is an iso 9660 disk (which means it can be used
by pc, macintosh, and other workstations as well), and contains a
total of 543mb of material, including:
x11r5 sources and core binaries (for sparc) as of several weeks after
the initial distribution, thus, four fixes and the the mit contrib-0
distribution are included (109mb of material). binaries for: x xsun

my beliefs, opinions, and expressions are strictly my own and do not

of any other person or organization....
but. i have heard that ford motor company has (had) a recruiting bias
toward engineers and away from computer science graduates. the reasoning
is supposedly to better meet long range personnel requirements. this is
evidenced by the large number of cs people who are employed via contracts
and are not brought on board except in special circumstances. this is
a generalization which obviously doesn't always hold true, but there are
statistics. furthermore, most ""software engineering"" at ford gets done
by electrical engineers. i know of 2 univerities that have merged the
computer science department and the electrical engineering so that you
can get a computer degree which qualifies you for much more than programming.

you can take xdm out of secure mode; probably not too cool.
you can wrap your call to xopendisplay in some code which solicts
a future sigalrm and longjmps past the xopendisplay from the signal
handler. an example of this can be seen in the xdm sources.
note that longjmping out of xopendisplay probably causes a memory

66457.eml,comp.windows.x,"what i like about gui's:
- the ability to view and manipulate a group of objects, files,
text, directories, etc. and and manipulate them in some way
such as delete, copy, paste, rename ...
- the ability to have several applications screens visible
and accessable at the same time.
- being able to do a standard set of functions easily and
quickly on an unfamiliar operating system. i am familiar with
the command lines of several operating systems but occasionally
i will have to some work on a system that i almost never use.
if it has a gui, i can usually accomplish what i want to do
fairly easily, the command line on the other hand often is
a long and painful experience.
what i hate about gui's:
- having to switch between the mouse and the keyboard. i guess
i have a strong one-handed preference. i like to use a
computer with one hand and use the other for holding something
like a piece of paper of a mug of tea. i have configured my
favorite editor so that most of the editing functions can be
done with one hand such as navigating, cutting, pasting,
searching, opening and saving files, etc. the main thing i
need to use both hands for is entering text.

hardware is always even a necessity.
this ""faq"" list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different
people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from x
windows on your workstation, without purchasing more hardware.
performance is a highly subjective issue. the individual user must
balance speed' versus features' in order to come to a personal
decision. therefore this document can be be expected to contain many
subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts.
this document is specifically concerned with x. there are of course
many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation.
however, they are outside the scope of this document. people seriously interested in the whole area of system
performance, might want to look at the o'reilly nutshell handbook

what about the ""other x faq""?
david b. lewis maintains the informative and
well written ""comp.windows.x frequently asked questions"" document.
its focus is on general x information, while this faq concentrates
on performance.
the comp.windows.x faq does address the issue of speed, but only with
regards to the x server. the gist of that topic seems to be:
""use x11r5, it is faster than r4"".
(please see the x faq for complete details).
window managers
there are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different
features and abilities. the choice of which to use is by necessity a
balancing act between performance and useful features. at this
point, most respondents have agreed upon ""twm"" as the best candidate
for a speedy window manager.
a couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,
is turning off unnecessary things like ""zooming"" and ""opaque move"".
also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the
amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping
windows. joe english i've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:
-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). it is
the biggest font i know of that i can use on my sun (1152x900 screen)
and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the
display with no overlap. other font suggestions will be accepted.
the x server
which server?
- - - - - - -
make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.
if you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome x11 server.
on my monochrome sun, i haven't noticed much difference between
the xsun (colour) server and xsunmono, however it was pointed out to
me that xsunmono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute
to less paging. thanks to: jonny farringdon michael salmon how your server was compiled can also make a difference. jeff law advises us that on a sun system, x should be
compiled with gcc (version 2. ) or with the unbundled sun compiler.
you can expect to get "" very large speedups in the server"" by not
using the bundled sunos compiler. i assume that similar results
would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial
compilers on the market.
locking the server into ram?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
has anyone tried hacking the x server so that it is locked into ram and
does not get paged? eg: via a call to plock(). does this help
performance at all? i've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few
pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone
who's tried it. i am not in a position to give it a try. thanks to: eric c claeys danny backx juan d. martin starting your server
- - - - - - - - - - -
joe english :
if you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep
for a second or two after launching each one. after i changed my
.xclients script to do this, logging in actually took less time...
we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.
this sounds crazy, but i have confirmed that it works!
warner losh provided me with a good explanation of
why this works, which i have summarized here:
when you start up an x server it takes a huge amount of time to
start accepting connections. a lot of initialization is done by
the server when it starts. this process touches a large number of
pages. any other process running at the same time would fight the
server for use of the cpu, and more importantly, memory. if you
put a sleep in there, you give the server a chance to get itself
sorted out before the clients start up.
similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an x
client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources
being fetched, programs initializing state and ""databases"" and so
forth. all this activity is typically memory intensive. once this
initialization is done (""the process has reached a steady state""),
the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.
by using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your
.xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your
workstation's limited resources
this is most definitely a ""your mileage may vary"" situation, as there
are so many variables to be considered: available ram, local swap
space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients
you are starting, etc.
currently in my .xinitrc i have a situation like:
(sleep 1; exec xclock ) (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) (sleep 1; exec xterm ) (sleep 1; exec xterm ) i've experimented with:
(sleep 1; exec xclock ) (sleep 2; exec xbiff ) (sleep 3; exec xterm ) (sleep 4; exec xterm ) i've even tried:
(sleep 2; exec start x clients script ) and then in start x clients script i had:
(sleep 1; exec xclock ) (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) (sleep 1; exec xterm ) (sleep 1; exec xterm ) the idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had
completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down
into a ""steady state"" before the sleep expired and all my clients
were launched. all of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so i just stuck with
my current setup, for its simplicity. you will probably have to
experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.
fonts
- - -
loading fonts takes time and ram. if you minimize the number of fonts
your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.
one simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one
large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or
at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.
client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded
into the server. this will also conserve server resources, since fewer
fonts will be loaded by the server. farrell mckay joe english eg: my main xterm font is 7x13, so i also have twm set up to use 7x13
in all it's menus and icons etc. twm's default font is 8x13. since
i don't normally use 8x13, i've eliminated one font from my server.
oliver jones keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.
if you will make extensive use of r5 scalable fonts, use a font server.
about the resources file
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
keep your .xresources .xdefaults file small. saves ram and saves
on server startup time. joe english one suggestion:
in your .xdefaults (.xresources) file, try putting only the minimum
number of resources that you want to have available to all of your
applications. for example: reversevideo: true
then, separate your resources into individual client-specific
resource files. for example: home lib app-defaults. in your
.login file set the environment variable xuserfilesearchpath:
setenv xuserfilesearchpath home lib app-defaults n the ""comp.windows.x frequently asked questions"" faq contains
an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.
so, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from
... app-defaults xterm. xdvi finds them in ... app-defaults xdvi,
and so on and so forth. note that not all clients follow the same
xxxxx resource-file naming pattern. you can check in your system
app-defaults directory (often: usr x11r5 lib x11 app-defaults ) to
find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files
with the same name.
this is all documented in the xt specification (pg 125 666). thanks to: kevin samborn michael urban and mike long kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers. this method of organizing your personal resources has the following
benefits:
- easier to maintain more usable.
- fewer resources are stored in the x server in the resource manager
property. as a side benefit your server may start fractionally
quicker, since it doesn t have to load all your resources.
- applications only process their own resources, never have to sort
through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.
it also has drawbacks:
- the application that you are interested in has to load an
additional file every time it starts up. this doesn't seem to
make that much of a performance difference, and you might
consider this a huge boon to usability. if you are modifying an
application's resource database, you just need to re-run the
application without having to ""xrdb"" again.
- xrdb will by default run your .xdefaults file through cpp. when
your resources are split out into multiple resource files and
then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.
watch out for this!!
i had c style comments in my .xdefaults file, which cpp stripped
out. when i switched to this method of distributed resource
files i spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why
my clients were not finding their resources. xt did not provide any error message when it encountered the c style
comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted
processing the resource file.
the loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ifdef
color'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this
method of resource management.
- you may also run into some clients which break the rules. for
example, neither emacs (18.58.3) nor xvt (1.0) will find their
resources if they are anywhere other than in .xdefaults.
- when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files
with the machine where your resources are stored, your client
will not find its resources. loading all your resources into the
server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find
their resources. casey leedom a possible compromise suggestion that i have (and am planning on trying)
is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my
.xdefaults file, and to use the ""separate resources files"" method for
clients that i seldom use.
define your display properly
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server. in
that situation, rather than setting your display environment variable to
"" :0.0"", where is the name of your workstation, you
should set your display variable to ""unix:0.0"" or "":0.0"". by doing this
you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same
machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests. thanks to patrick j horgan see the display names section of the x(1) man page for further
explanation of how to properly set your display name.
""i don't think it's stock mit, but (at least) data general and hp have
libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when
the display isn't set specially.""
rob sartin jody goldberg sent me an xlib patch to change
stock r5 to use local communication even if display is not properly set.
i don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle
non-mit patches and so have elected not to include it here. hopefully mit
will apply this minor ( 8 lines) patch themselves. in the meantime, if
you want to try it yourself, email jody. --ed. clients
if you only have a few megabytes of ram then you should think
carefully about the number of programs you are running. think also
about the kind of programs you are running. for example: is there
a smaller clock program than xclock?
unfortunately, i haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large
they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word. suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients
(eg: xclock, xterm, xbiff) are welcome. --ed. i've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject
of x client programs. some advocate the use of programs that are
strictly xlib based, since xt, xaw and other toolkits are rather
large. others warn us that other applications which you are using
may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries. in
this case, using a non-xt (for example) client program may actually increase the amount of ram consumed.
the upshot of all this seems to be: don't mix toolkits. that is, try
and use just athena clients, or just xview clients (or just motif
clients, etc). if you use more than one, then you're dragging in
more than one toolkit library.
know your environment, and think carefully about which client
programs would work best together in that environment. thanks to: rob sartin duncan sinclair a better clock for x
- - - - - - - - - - -
1) xcuckoo
suggested by: duncan sinclair available: on export.lcs.mit.edu
xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of another program.
saves screen real estate.
2) mclock
suggested by: der mouse available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in x mclock.shar
non xt-based. extensively configurable. it can be made to look
very much like mit oclock, or mostly like xclock purely by changing
resources.
of course, the ultimate clock --- one that consumes no resources, and
takes up no screen real estate --- is the one that hangs on your wall.
:-)
a better terminal emulator for x
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
from the readme file distributed with xterm: ----- -----
ugly maybe, but at my site it's still the most used. i suspect that
xterm is one of the most used clients at many, if not most sites.
laziness? isn't there a better terminal emulator available? see below.
if you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of savelines
to reduce memory usage. oliver jones jonny farringdon 1) xvt
suggested by: richard hesketh :
available: export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib xvt-1.0.tar.z
""...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get
hold of xvt ... it was written here just to save swap space as
xterm is rather a hog! ""
this was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm. you don't have to
rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be xterm. in it's current
version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm. i've heard that
there are versions of xvt with this feature, but i've not found any
yet.
update (march 1993): i recently had a few email conversations with
brian warkentin regarding xvt. he
questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm. for
instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling
speed (try this quickie benchmark: bin time dd if etc termcap
bs 40) and see which program can scroll faster. also, while xterm
may be slightly larger in ram requirements (we don't have any hard
numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text
segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.
as an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it
made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets
brought into memory.
so here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of
xvt over xterm. in summary? caveat emptor, your mileage may vary.
if you can provide some hard data, i'd like to see it.
specifically: how much ram each occupies, how much swap each needs,
relative speed of each
2) mterm
suggested by: der mouse available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in x mterm.src mterm.ball-o-wax.
""i also have my own terminal emulator. its major lack is
scrollback, but some people like it anyway.""
tuning your client
- - - - - - - - - -
suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster.
from scott barman comes a suggestion regarding motif
text field widgets:
i noticed that during data entry into motif text field widgets, i
was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes,
particularly the initial one in the field. examining the what was
going on with xscope i found it. it seems that when the resource
xmnblinkrate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget
(or even just a text widget) the i-beam cursor will blink.
every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the
widget code is making a request to the server (copyarea). the user
can stop this by setting the resource xmnblinkrate to 0. it is not
noticeable on a 40mhz sparc, but it does make a little difference
on a slower system .
this specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots
of areas. consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor
embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on server
requests?
miscellaneous suggestions
pretty pictures
- - - - - - - -
don't use large bitmaps (gif's, etc) as root window backgrounds.
- the more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server
is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)
- these take up ram, and cpu power. i work on a sun sparc and i'm
conscious of performance issues, i can't comprehend it when i see
people with a 4mb sun 3 60 running xphoon as their root window.
i'll let someone else figure out how much ram would be occupied by
having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.
- if you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate
that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway. thanks to qiang alex zhao for reminding me of this one. --ed. a quicker mouse
- - - - - - - -
using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen
when you move your mouse. i use ""xset m 3 10"" in my .xinitrc file,
which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of
the wrist. see the xset man page for further ideas and information.
hint: sometimes you may want to slow down your mouse tracking for
fine work. to cover my options, i have placed a number of different
mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.
e.g. (for twm) :
menu ""mouse settings"" ""mouse settings:"" f.title
"" very fast"" ! ""xset m 7 10 ""
"" normal (fast)"" ! ""xset m 3 10 ""
"" system default (un-accelerated)""	! ""xset m default ""
"" glacial"" ! ""xset m 0 10 "" programming thoughts
- - - - - - - - - - -
joe english :
to speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of
things you can do. some that stick out:
- for motif programs, don't set xmfontlist resources for individual
buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultfontlist or
labelfontlist or whatever resource of the highest-level manager
widget. again, stick to as few fonts as possible.
- better yet, don't use motif at all. it's an absolute pig.
- don't create and destroy widgets on the fly. try to reuse them.
(this will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)
- use a line width of 0 in gcs. on some servers this makes a huge
difference.
- compress and collapse multiple expose events. this can make the
difference between a fast application and a completely unusable
one.
francois staes :
just a small remark: i once heard that using a better malloc
function would greatly increase performance of xt based
applications since they use malloc heavily. they suggested trying
out the gnuy malloc, but i didn't find the time yet. i did some
tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the
differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster) any confirmation on this from anyone? --ed. andre' beck :
- unnecessary noexpose events.
most people use xcopyarea xcopyplane as fastest blit routines, but
they forget to reset graphics exposures in the gc used for the
blits. this will cause a noexpose event every blit, that, in most
cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to
run through it's event-loop again and again.
- thousands of xchangegc requests.
this ""gfx context switching"" is also seen in most handcoded x-apps,
where only one or few gcs are created and then heavily changed
again and again. xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching
and sharing a lot of gcs with all needed parameters. this will
remove the load of subsequent xchangegc requests from the
connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).
say what!?
- - - - - -
some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:
david b. lewis (by day: by night: :
how about this: swap displays with someone else. run all your programs
on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your
machine onto the other display. goal: reduce context switches in the
same operation between client and server.
i'm not in a situation where i can easily try this, but i have received
the following confirmation...
michael salmon i regularly run programs on other machines and i notice a big
difference. i try to run on a machine where i will reduce net usage
and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. this
helps a lot on my poor little ss1 with only 16 mb, it was
essential when i only had 8 mb.
casey leedom : the x11 server and the client are competing for the same cpu as
your server when you run it on the same machine. not really a
major problem, except that the x11 client and the server are in
absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.
timothy h panton :
firstly it relies on the fact that most cpu's are mostly idle, x's
cpu usage is bursty. so the chances of you and your teammate
doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. if they
are not then you get twice the cpu memory available for your
action.
the second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2
cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going
over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved
buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing
even fewer context switches.

66881.eml,comp.windows.x,"i have the same problem. i have looked at motif , wwl, interviews, gina ,
and a few variations on the above. i've also done a cursory examination
of rogue wave's view.h . i like view.h 's abstractions best of all of the
toolkits i mentioned, but the resulting code looks little like motif, and i
have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result
in significant longevity for my code. gina allows you to write code which
looks a great deal like motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance,
but the resulting code is almost too motif-like, and is certainly not
significantly less verbose than equivalent c code. interviews looks
promising, but i haven't found a free version with motif support, and i'm
not confident how widely interviews with motif support will be adopted,
and what (if any) specific motif support will be available over time. the
other libraries produce code which is less motif-like, but which does not make
sufficient use of the features of c to simplify my coding task.
at this point, my inclination is to write my motif manipulation routines in
c, and invoke those routines from my c code using simple abstractions suited
to my specific task. later, if osf or some credible standards-setting body
comes up with a c interface to motif, i will change to that. it does me
no goo to write in c if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which
leaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry
directions. it's better to take a standard if inferior solution for now
than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both
useless code and useless skills a few years from now. views.h is the only
library i'd consider right now, but in our environment, we'd end up spending
nearly 5000 to use it, and i can't justify it when it's likely to cause
short-term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction, and is
unlikely to be a sufficiently long-lived solution for us to reap the benefits
at the high end of the j curve.

66892.eml,comp.windows.x,"a few days ago i posted my announcement for an update of motif . i got
several requests to send the bindings per e-mail, and i know of several people
who have been using motif , and there are probably a number of people i am
not aware of who are also using motif .
my question is:
how many people 'out there' would be interested to join a mailing-list, where
people can ask questions about motif , swap stories, and give new ideas about
new directions and improvements for the bindings. this would benefit the
user-community, as well as give me more insight in what people would like to
see added to motif . motif is still very much a voluntary project, and this
way i can make a list of priorities, in what order things should be added, or
changed.
if you're interested in joining such a mailing-list, please take the time to
reply to this message, and tell me so. when there is sufficient interest, say
about 20 people or more, a mailing-list will be set up at my site, and i will
post the announcement of the newly-created list to this and other newsgroups.

pseudocolor 8 bit, truecolor 24 bit and directcolor 24 bit.
a problem occurs when i try to create a window with a visual that is different
from the visual of the parent (which uses the default visual which is tc24).
in the xlib reference guide from 'o reilly one can read in the
section about xcteatewindow, something like:
""in the current implementation of x11: when using a visual other than the
parent's, be sure to create or find a suitable colourmap which is to be used
in the window attributes when creating, or else a badmatch occurs.""
this warning, strangely enough, is only mentioned in the newer editions
of the x11r5 guides.
however, even if i pass along a suitable colourmap, i still get a badmatch
when i create a window with a non-default visual.
the code looks like this:
window create 8bit window on truecolour display(dpy,width,height)
display dpy;
int width, height; window win;
xvisualinfo vinfo;
xsetwindowattributes attr;
fprintf(stderr,""opening 8 bit window... n"");

66903.eml,comp.windows.x,"i think you will find that the active linux and 386bsd communities are
populated by enthusiasts who would object to paying any money for software.
otherwise, they would probably have gone for a commercial unix.
an important factor in the linux community is that source code is always
available (this is probably similar in the 386bsd community, however, i'm not
really involved there). many people using linux like to stay at the cutting
(bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches, c library or compiler patches come
out, people like to rebuild their entire systems. the prime requirement for
all linux software is that it is available under a gnu style public license.
hence, linux software uses either the athena widgets or xview.
individuals may write software requiring motif, but i doubt it is widely
adopted.

your might take a look a plplot. version 4.99c (actually beta v5.0)
can be found anonymous ftp from hagar.ph.utexas.edu, in the pub plplot
directory.
from the readme file of version 4.99c:
this is the plplot distribution. plplot is a scientific plotting package for
many systems, small (micro) and large (super) alike. despite its small size
and quickness, it has enough power to satisfy most users, including: standard
x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3d plots, mesh plots,
bar charts and pie charts. multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes)
may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph. different
line styles, widths and colors are supported. a virtually infinite number of
distinct area fill patterns may be used. there are almost 1000 characters in
the extended character set. this includes four different fonts, the greek
alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols. the fonts
can be scaled to any size for various effects. many different output device
drivers are available (system dependent), including a portable metafile
format and renderer.
the plplot package is freely distributable, but not in the public domain.
the plplot source code, except header files and those files explicitly
granting permission, may not be used in a commercial software package without
consent of the authors. you are allowed and encouraged to include the plplot
object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it
is explicitly and prominently stated that the plplot library is freely
available, and (2) the full copyrights on the plplot package be displayed
somewhere in the documentation for the package.
we welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in the form of
user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes. if plplot is used in any
published papers, please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work,
which will help us to continue improving plplot. also, please remember that
as plplot is not a commercial product, we cannot be expected to offer the
kind of support that a commercial product may. there is great interest
in extending plplot and fixing bugs, but the principal authors can only
afford to work on it part time. improvements will necessarily focus on
those which help us get our work done.
plplot is written in c, enabling it to run on many platforms practically
without modification. fortran programs may use it transparently; stub
routines are provided to handle the c fortran interface without any
modification of the user program. c programs are required to include the
header file ""plplot.h""; see the documentation for more details.
the main documentation for plplot is in the doc directory in the form of
several tex files; please consult this for additional information ('latex
plotdoc'). unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to
the code, so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained
there. consult 'changes.log' to see a list of recent changes.
at present, plplot is known to work on the following systems:
unix:	sunos
a ix
hp-ux
unicos
dg ux
ultrix
sysv
linux
amiga exec
ms-dos
os 2
next
for more information on how to get or use plplot on your system, see:
- appendices to the plplot manual
- system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys directory.
to become a subscriber to the plplot mailing list, send a request to credits
plplot is the result of the effort of many people, so it is impractical to
list all the contributors. those currently supporting and otherwise
responsible for the package in its present form include:

please send all comments, flames, patches, etc, to me. i am responsible for

xrdb command. if i try:
xrdb .xdefaults
the defaults ""won't take.""
so, i tried to change the xrdb call in my .xinitrc file from:
xrdb home .xdefaults
to:
xrdb -m home .xdefaults
no go. so i tried adding in:
xrdb -m home kbw .xdefaults
at the beginning or end of my .openwin-init file. still no go.
any notions what gives? thanks for the help.

66928.eml,comp.windows.x,"let me add another of my concerns: yes, i can buy a port of motif for ""cheap"",
but i cannot get the source for ""cheap"", hence i am limited to using whatever x
libraries the motif port was compiled against (at least with older versions of
motif. i have been told that motif 1.2 can be used with any x, but i have not
seen it myself).
currently, i have x11r5 running on eight different unix platforms, of which
only three came with motif. on those three, i am unable to use the x11r5
libraries to build motif clients, because i get link errors between the
vendor-supplied port of motif and my x11r5. i anticipate having this same
problem when x11r6 becomes available.
the result is that i cannot build motif clients that rely on x11r5, since i do
not have motif compiled under x11r5. true, i could buy another port of motif,
but that sort of ruins the whole idea of ""free"", doesn't it?

plugging flaming the two. i was responding to the sweet blithe statement in: from (rick richardson)
rick this is one area where microsoft nt has a big advantage. since
rick they control the whole show, there are no issues like this where
rick licensees create incompatible defacto standards.
this happy statement shows a mindset that inventors and companies have when
they are pleased with something that works, and they believe that others will
also be happy to use it. i remember when sunview was hot stuff (and am not,
by that statement, endorsing sun and its products, this is just my experience),
and when openwindows became hot stuff, that was when i started hearing, as
mentioned before, the ""socialistic masses"" that were bent on destroying anything that was deemed proprietary, including openwindows. i mentioned
motif in the same breath, because that is what sun has decided to turn its
attention to, not because i hate it. mr. richardson's position, i believe, is
a healthy one, and i am sure that the seething hackers will soon try to
flame and destroy nt, if it ever shows up, wanting instead everything to be
free, and then complaining when there is no organized structure and there are
no de facto standards.
it was just a vent for frustration brought on by prevailing winds.

66944.eml,comp.windows.x,"i am working on a project to provide an emergency management
information system. in keeping with more classic command and
control type systems, we are considering developing a dual screen monitor
system in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor.
i have a number of x level questions regarding this:
(we are devloping on unix systems using x motif. platform will be
predominantly sun's, probably with ports to rs 6000 as well).
i am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured
such that we are talking about one x display and multiple screens,
and not multiple x displays. given this:
- is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple
as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other? there's
nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between
screens?
- do i have to run separate window managers on the separate
screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there?
what are they; who sells them...
- is a multi-screen window manager the only way i can grab a
window frame and move a window from one screen to the next?
- is there any way for the application to transparently see
multiple screens as one logical x-y plane, or does the hardware
only provide for each screen to start at 0,0?
- any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a
system capable of using either multiple screens or a single
screen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate
multiple screens instead)?
i am assuming that this is not a major issue - that i can rely
on providing config files which will specify for each
configuration the screen placement of each window in the
application. any thoughts or suggestions from past experience
are more than welcome. jo pelkey phone: (509)375-6947

think multi-tasking is really neat (add puke here) and are overjoyed to
be able to use more than 64k of memory, its a major improvement. for windows
users its more like an upgrade with facilities most unix users take for
granted. most of windows users only use pcs for text processing or running
3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even
a real issue. my ideal operating system:
binary compatible across all plaforms. it should recognize
binaries and configure on the fly, so i don't have to have
bin mac bin dos bin dec bin sun bin hp etc...
multi-cpu. so i can use the cpus on my pc and w s and mac
and transputers and dsps. i don't know a single site which
has gone for a single vendor. i am not going to trade-in
80mflops per h1 transputer or ultra-fast fft on dsp chips.
note nt runs on symmetric multi-cpu systems.
built-in portable gui graphics tools. you can call drawbutton
or drawline and it does the same thing no matter what platform
or display. it should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly.
so i can use pc graphics s w on my workstation and x software on
my pc. i think guis are not just nice to have but essential.
configurable front-end. so you can make it look like unix or dos
or nt or os 2, and run shell scripts or command bat files.
object oriented. so i can program easily under it and not have
to re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch
or my application needs to access source object code on the fly.
in other words it should have some ai capability. that and a tight, clean
kernel so you can actually understand it. anyone know of something like this ?

74789.eml,misc.forsale,"i'll third the opinion about this outfit franchise. now, when i
buy over the net and pick up the shipping costs, i'll specify that i
only pick up the normal ups charges (as if delivered directly to
ups), as i've been burned by 10 shipping charges for a 2.49 pkg.
i will never use a mailing service unless i don't have the
right box and the buyer needs whatever immediately. i'll also
tell the person, if they agreed to pick up shipping, what is going on.
other things to watch out for consider:
the rates are 5 to 30 higher than ups direct.
for a non-ups (truck) package, they quoted a rate
of 85. fed ex economy air was only 85 for the
same weight! rps (a trucking package company, in many
cities) only wanted 18. guess who got it. the mailbox
operator told me i was not telling the truth about
competitors' rates, said rps was unreliable (i've used them
before with no problems), etc. right.
a cod check goes to the mailing service. our local
mailbox then takes its sweet time mailing me the
remade check. all this for an additional 3.00 over the
ups cod charge. what a deal.... :-)
for packages over 100, they charge you about double over
what ups charges them for insurance. i've never had
a claim, but other netters (is ralph seguin out there?)
have told horror stories about them...
all package traces have to be done through mailbox by
mailbox.
our local mailbox operator told me i was lying when i
asked him why their rates were stratospheric compared
to direct ups. does he ever check? probably not...
their ups ground rates come close to fed ex's economy
air rate, and fed ex will pick up!
ups will pick up for a 5 charge in most areas!

saner than stacker 2.0 (which i've replaced). memmaker is nowhere near as
aggressive as qemm, but it doesn't hose my system like qemm did (at least
it hasn't yet). microsoft antivirus is just the latest version (or a
reasonably recent one) of cpav - mine was very aged, so this was quite welcome.
ms-dos 6.0 ain't the end all, be all of operating systems - but it's
better than a sharp stick in the eye, unless you happen to be into that sort

75854.eml,misc.forsale,"waxworks by horrorsoft accolade (5.25"") 30
by the same folks who brought you elvira i ii. i played
elvira i ii, and think that horrorsoft has finally made
a very playable game with waxworks. the look and feel is
roughly the same as in the elvira games, though the real time
fighting is a little easier to survive. the first two games,
especially elvira ii: jaws of cerberus made it very tough to
stay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult. this
is not to say that waxworks is a walk in the park, but it is
quite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be found
that is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fighting
strategy. in one of the four wax works to be explored, there is
no fighting at all (well almost none), though all four contain
moderately challanging puzzles.
the really interesting thing about this game is that it is really
broken up into four seperate rpgs, one for each of the four exhibits
you must enter. in starting each one, your character is transported
with no objects to use, and experience level 1. one exhibits traps
you inside a multi-level ancient egyptian pyramid which you must
escape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving. another exhibit
traps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines
and pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plant
zombies. this is a single level maze that requires you to rescue
some humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to kill
the very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up. this is
perhaps the most horrifying exhibit. another exhibit puts you into
jack the ripper england where you appear by the corpse of a fresh ripper
victim, and of course the police think you are responsible. you must
avoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of the ripper and
meet him face to face - but first get a disquise. the last exhibit
pus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to
stop the almost indestructible zombies.
over all the vga graphics and music are very effective in setting a
creepy tone for the game, as was the case for the elvira games, though
gameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game.
i heartily recommend it for rpg and horror fans. - all prices include shipping.
- all games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated.

you're not supposed to use a newsgroup to plug your own commercial

i don't know whether this is an official usenet rule or just a long-

if the dealer profit is 1000, then you would only be paying 12k for
the same car. so isn't that saving money?
moreover, if saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by 1000,
then their cars will be even better deals. say, if the price of a saturn was
already 1000 below market average for the class of cars, then after they
reduce the dealer profit, it would be 2000 below market average. it will:
1) attract even more people to buy saturns because it would save them money.
2) force the competitors to lower their prices to survive.
now, not only will saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit, even
the buyers for other cars will pay less.

1984 volvo 244....175,000 miles, still on the road.
and i'll admit, the dealer repair cost is high. but with some mechanical
aptitude of your own, and finding a good indi mechanic, you can avoid most
breakdowns, and make the rest cheap(the sum total of the repairs on the car with
195,000 miles has been 2 mufflers and a radiator. whoa. bad repair record).
and all of these cars are driven fairly hard. none of them are at the head of
a line of cars going 30 mph....the first two spend a lot of their operating
life with the speedometer pegged...and the only reason the 84 doesn't is it has

101561.eml,rec.autos,"you always believe those exact numbers, why don't you drive a gs-r, and see
for your self, while the gs-r has a low 117 torqye, its high gearing over a 8000
rpm make up for the difference (still wouldn't call it a torque moster though!)
quad 4 reliable, yeah, what's your definition of reliable- if that's reliable,
then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect
(not to mention, a hell of alot smoother and quieter - balance shafts.the acura has the engine
wins the reliablity contest hands down. you can rev that car all day, everyday,
and you'll never blow a hose, or crack the block, or anything else. (i speak
from expierence!)
i'm not saying the quad 4 is a bad engine, but don't highlight reliability when you
comparing it to a acura engine. and while the integra costs alot more, it is a
better investment since it will hold its value considerably much better. and
does a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time.

chrome bumpers (ride height, generally more power). the older cars are
appreciating... slowly. the newer ones seem to be at a stable level at the

if the car is in good shape and regular maintenance is kept up on it, the car

101580.eml,rec.autos,"some 'tips and techniques' are included here:
i found that i needed some smaller sockets to undo the shocks.
and a can of wd40 helped...
the sockets needed were metric (exact fit) but i was able to use
some sae sockets... 13 16 and 15 16 are rather close to 21 and 24mm...
it can be fun having a canadian ford ...
didn't have to undo the end bolts bushings. just the 2 u bolts on
each side and the shock absorber. jacking up the frame some more
(had to put the spare tire on the garage floor and put a wooden
platform on top of that to get the 'floor jack' high enough to
raise the frame ... i't one talll truck...) lifted the spring
free of the axel. taking out the block gave me enough room to
undo the pin holding the spring pack together.
the spring pack was held together with a nut on top and a round head
on the other end.... no wrench head... vice grips worked fine...
i soaked the nut with wd40 and it came right off.
flipped the bottom spring and then...
i donno ... i'm a little more sore today than after working on a
1911a1 ...
a 1.5 foot pipe cheater was a real help. torque spec for the u bolt
nuts is 150 to 200 ft-lbs (!). a 1911-a1 doesn't have that kind of
torque spec ...
it was a 'challenge' to get the 'pack bolt' back in the spring pack.
squeeze pack with two hands, hold bolt with third, put nut on
with fourth while picking up wrench and vice grips with fifth
and sixth hands ... i used some string to tie the pack together
while holding the pin in for alignment... then i could let go
to get the nut, wrench, vice grips... .
getting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too...
until i discovered that the axel had 1) tilted and or 2) rolled forward.
one the drivers side, a bottle jack under the front of the differential
tilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right
hole. on the passenger side, i had to wrestle the wheel into rolling
forward about 1 2 inch to get things to line up. spent more than an
hour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift block
with levers and ropes and impliments of distruction before i took a
break and thought about why it wasn't lined up anymore (since it had
been lined up before, and i didn't move it, something else must
have ... hmmm, axle no longer constrained not to move ... hmmm, move
it back... hmmm...).
after that, it was all much easier to 'close up'.
btw, the ride is now softer, but not quite as soft as i was hoping for.
at least it now sits level..

the gtz does come with much bigger 16"" wheels.
the c d figures are almost certainly bogus and based on a hot prototype

16.1 sounds reasonable, probably faster than regular integras.
the gsr gearing is horrible for day to day driving. it needs a 6 speed
box more than any other modern car. essentially 5th in a regualr integra
equals 4th in the gsr, and the regular integras are very buzzy at speed.

101605.eml,rec.autos,"i don't happen to have my sae manual handy, but oil viscosity in general decreases with temperature. the sae numbers are based on a typical'
curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a
room-temperature 90-weight at 0c, down to (say) that of a room-temperature
5-weight at 20c, for a typical 40-weight oil.
oils that are designed for operation in normal' temperatures just have
a weight specification. oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly
cold temperatures have a w' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold
place, you'd stick 10w in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer,
to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.
modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature.
as a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves. a multi-vis
specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a normal' operating
temperature and a cold' one (though i can't remember the numbers...).
in any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference. remember
that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and
radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or
something.
any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized
oil. thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature,
thicker oil will (like a 20w50) will lubricate better at temperature,
but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.
if you're planning on making long drives, the 20w50 is probably fine
(esp. in the summer) in your 10w40 car. but if you're making short drives,
stick to the 10w40.

crucial to our national defense. anyway, by the 20s there were plenty
of good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly
expanding into the countryside. this was the era, after all, of the
first auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. two good

as to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early
teens there were virtually no american cars that did not have the wheel
on the left. in the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the

instead of a wheel. this was standardized fairly early on, though i

well be selling a car intended on giving the dealer a 2000 profit, but
since a comperable honda with 500 profit is more expensive, it may be well
worth it to buy the saturn.
not necessarily. it seems to me that saturn salesdroids, who don't
make a commision, whereas their counterparts at other dealerships generally
do, make more per hour or whatever. this means that saturn doesn't give up
the profit to their employees through commision, which is taken out of per-
car profits. they just pass it along to less pressureing salesmen women.

it was in the night. (in the 'big' cities like stockholm gothenburg
all trafic was forbidden, exept busses and taxis, during the whole
weekend.) the day was a sunday and everything was prepared in before.
before the day we was told to follow the yellow lines on the road and
after it was the white one that matters. the signs with arrows on was
prepared with a 'left mode' label that was torn off that night to
reveal the new right mode arrow.
the year after iceland also changed.
about cars: before the h-day (h as in ""hoegertrafik"". ""hoeger"" is
swedish and stands for 'right') practically all cars already had their
steering wheels on the left side. even the imported cars from uk had
the wheel on 'the right side'. at last we have cars with the wheels on
the right side. :-)

the safety inspection in pennsylvania. the problem is that the car has
aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. the tint is rather
weak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.
the inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless i get a
waiver from the state police. so i went to the state police - the
officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and i can get a
waiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. i asked him to
show me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal. he
showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if
you can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. when i told
him that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book
and said ""it's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you
a ticket for it right now."" well, won't argue with that...
since the vehicle code says it's ok as long as you can see through the
tint, i'd like to keep it (i'll re-read the vehicle code in the
library). i'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police
that says it's ok, so i can get the inspection, and so that i won't
get in trouble for the tint later on. i also wouldn't mind registering
a complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.
so does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from
the police, especially in pennsylvania? does anyone have any experience
registering a complaint against an officer? i called the station
later on today, but they basically said there is no place where i
could register a complaint against an officer... and if i do decide
to keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do
i stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?
any comments about it will be welcome!

while it is true that quad4's have a problem with head gasket leaks, that was
a design flaw in the gasket and has been corrected. also i know pontiac is
replacing head gaskets that leak for free for 6year 60k miles. other than
that i have found my quad4 to be completely solid and the direct ignition
system means no wires rotor rotor-cap to ever deal with. also hydrolic lifters

think you are going overboard on slamming the quad4. you are quite correct

101671.eml,rec.autos,"personally, i wouldn't use the 1.29 product from kmart. i knew about
this previously, but this past weekend on pbs's motorweek pat goss
(their resident tech type) discussed these products, and recommends
not using them (i.e, the non-isopropyl alcohlo based injector cleaners).
supposedly only the isopropyl based cleaners actually remove moisture
from your fuel tank as they clean your injectors. and although the
others (ethyl based) do clean injectors they also cause rubber
components in the fuel system to deteriorate, and they don't mix well
with water to help remove it from the fuel system.
i use a product recommended by vw called 44k (by bg products, inc.).
it cost more about 14.00, but it is supposed to do the job without
the potential harmful side effects, and its results are supposed to
last from 2k to 4k miles. i have also used chevron's techtrolene (sp?).
i can't say that i have noticed any difference using either, since i
only use these product as a preventative maintenance item.

101677.eml,rec.autos,"ok, here's what i understand:
the sl sl1 sl2 sw1 sw2 was meant to compete with the following cars:
honda civic
toyota tercel (sl,sl1)
toyota corolla (sl1,sl2)
nissan sentra
mazda 323 protoge'
subaru loyale impreza
isuzu stylus
geo prizm
ford escort
mercury tracer
mistubishi mirage
plymouth dodge colt
their core competition is the civic, corolla, and sentra. most of the other
models are in the same class, but aren't the first cars you would think of.
i threw in the escort tracer because it has a good amount of japanese
technology and has similar reliability stats. i didn't include domestic small
cars such as the cavalier, sunbird, shadow, sundance, tempo, and topaz, since i
think saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of japanese
roots.
the sc1 sc2 was meant to compete against the following cars:
toyota paseo
honda civic si civic coupes del sol si
nissan nx1600 nx2000
mazda mx-3
isuzu impulse
geo storm
ford escort gt
if you look at the prices of these cars, they're more expensive than they're
4-door counterparts. the is good reason for this. it is a more upscale and
trend-driven market. even though many of these models are based on sedan
platforms, their interior, etc. is good enough to warrant slightly higher
prices. here are some of the platform derivations i can think of:
tercel - paseo
sentra - nx1600 nx2000
civic - del sol
323 - mx-3 (not sure on this one)
stylus - impulse storm
to illustrate, a tercel starts at around 8000, while the paseo starts at
around 11,000. even a 4-door tercel will cost less than a 2-door paseo. now,
you might be saying that the tercel doesn't offer the power that some 4-doors
offer. what i mean is that there is no 4-dr tercel with a comparable
powerplant as its sport coupe derivative. let's take another example: the
isuzu stylus xs and impulse xs storm gsi. both have the same powerplants (a
1.6l 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive.
again, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more
fashion-oriented and trend-setting segment. people are willing to pay more
money for this type of car.
in short, even though the sc1 sc2 may be smaller, hence ""less"" car, it's market
orientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent
sedan (sl1 sl2) version.
i hope this clears things up a bit......

rack, that do the job as competently (albeit, not as swiftly), if not
more accurate, due to the natural pride an owner mechanic places on his work.
you can do an acceptable' job of aligning a car using simple tools and
some imaginative work that would never have the effect of endangering
anyones life. the worst that happens is that your tires wear oddly (well,

difficult to adjust and measure ... i used a micrometer to measure the

agreed on a price. i wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax
and license and told them i'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.
when i returned, i had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could
get to me. when i finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he
started adding up the numbers. he then discovered that they had
miscalculated the tax license by about 150. he then said he needed
another 150 from me. i said we had already agreed on a price and it was
their problem, i wasn't giving them any more money. the finance guy then
brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. i
reminded him that i was the customer and i didn't think i should be
treated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole
deal. he made some smart remark so i told him where he could stick it,
snatched back my check and left. needless to say, they were not pleased by
the turn of events.
early the next morning i got a call from the general sales manager wanting
to know what happened. i related the story and he apologised profusely and
asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. i told him
that if they gave me the truck for free i probably still wouldn't take it,
that there were other dealers in town, i was a repeat customer of theirs
and that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...i was still
pretty steamed about the whole affair. he gave me the line about hating to
lose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. i told
him not to bother, thanks, i'd go somewhere else.
a couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all
apologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the 150 plus
knock another 400 off the price of the truck. i told him i'd think about
it and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,
and assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....
i thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we
decided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so i called him
back and accepted his offer. when i went back the next day to pick up the
truck, i received the royal treatment. everyone seemed to know about the
incident, even the lot boy. everything went smoothly and i was out of
there in my new truck in about 30 mins.
so, i guess i'm a reasonably satisfied customer. however, it should not
have happened in the first place. i was a bit shocked to have a sales
person talk to me like that. i don't expect them to bow and grovel, but i
sure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their

introduction to the rec.autos newsgroup hierarchy:
rec.autos.tech
is intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design,
construction, diagnosis, and service. other discussions are largely
inappropriate, especially for sale ads.
rec.autos.sport
is intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving
automobiles. technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply
to competition vehicles. discussion from either of two viewpoints,
spectator and participant, is encouraged. arguments about sports cars are
largely inappropriate, as are most other discussions. for sale ads are
inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and or equipment.
discussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid
advocating breaking the law. (remember, the fbi reads usenet!)
rec.autos.driving
is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles.
also, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or boneheads, do it here.
rec.autos.vw
is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership
of automobiles manufactured by volkswagen (this includes vws, audis,
seats, etc.) it was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing
list was very successful. it should not be presumed from the existence
of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many
different marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be
created on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as
a mailing list.
rec.audio.car
is not properly part of the rec.autos. hierarchy. it is, however,
the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and
so is mentioned here.
rec.autos.antique
is intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years
old, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)
alt.hotrod
is not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the
rec.autos reader. it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing
list, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing

crossposting:
crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on
the newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear
in all of the newsgroups listed.
crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on
usenet. you should only post to a group because you feel an article is
appropriate; you should never crosspost just to reach a particular
audience. this distinction is subtle, but important. radar detector
articles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos. they are
almost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact
that you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or
rec.ham-radio is not adequate justification for posting to either group.
crossposting between any or all of the rec.autos. groups is usually
inappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is
truly advisable, before sending your article. consider setting followup-to:
to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.
crossposting between rec.autos. and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in
particular flame wars over the speed limit in the us and or the use of
radar detectors should never be crossposted between any of these groups.
most readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio. couldn't care less about
the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in
rec.autos.
it is an excellent idea to check the newsgroups: and followup-to: lines of
articles before posting a followup. in particular, be wary of posting to
misc.test, rec.arts.startrek. , or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these
three. the life you save may be your own.
distribution:
there is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to
(partially) control where the article goes; it is called the distribution
field. it may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve
as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.
the distribution of rec.autos. is fairly extensive. as of this writing,
the automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of europe, australia,
new zealand, and some locations in japan. with this in mind, i offer the
following hints about use of the distribution: field in your article
headers, and on article content.
1) please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out ford
mavericks in new jersey to france or california; i doubt that anyone in
either place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange
reason likes mavericks (but only 4-door mavericks, at that.)
2) when posting technical questions, please include the market for which
your car was manufactured. for example, there are a number of differences
between a european-market ford escort and a us-market escort. likewise,
all 1750cc and early 2000cc alfa romeos reached the us with spica fuel
injection; european market cars usually got carbs (often webers). these
differences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear.
failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant
spread of misinformation.
3) be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting;
in the us we get a mix of metric and english system values, whereas
europe is almost entirely on the metric system. a future edition
of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used
abbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos
reaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.
4) use the distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when
possible. within north america, the values na (north america), can
(canada), and usa may be used. in addition, the two-letter state
abbreviations of the us are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted
to send an article only to new york and new jersey, i could put
""ny,nj"" in a distribution field. note that multiple, comma-separated
values are legal. these distribution fields vary widely, however, so
you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely
to be supported in your area.
the dangers of overgeneralization:
to amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article:
be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc. what is
true for a 1973 buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a
1976 honda with a 1200cc engine. headlight laws in sweden are decidedly
different from those in idaho.
the need for adequate specification:
when you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information;
e.g., if you have a question about your honda, please specify year,
model, engine size, etc. otherwise, most answers to your question may be
quite useless.
concerning lemons:
at one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or
two; even honda admits to this. please don't waste everyone's time by
announcing to the world that your brand x' automobile is terrible, so all brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from
the brand x' company. such articles are worse than useless, because they
cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful
information.
concerning flames:
as much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most
likely will never occur. here are some guidelines for flames and how
to deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section
of this posting):
if you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a
minute that including the words no flames' will work. it won't, and
you'll get exactly what you deserve.
if you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can
cite a fact or maybe a well-known reference. no one is likely to believe
bald, unsupported assertions.
be careful about who you choose to insult. consider not insulting anyone.
asking the question:
it is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like please
send email, i don't read this group'. it is a much better idea to
end the question with please send email, if there is sufficient interest
i'll summarize the results in a later posting. i may miss posted responses
to this request'.
answering the question:
if someone wants to hop up their yugo, don't tell them to get a mustang.
either be silent, or give them useful advice. if someone wants advice on
defending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time --
it's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directly
address the original question. in general, don't post in order to see
your words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and
self-righteous.
stale and or inflammatory topics:
certain topics are considered stale by old timers'; while discussion of
them is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings
about them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them
ignored altogether. some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is
difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them. some
of these topics include the following:
1) the 55mph speed limit in the us: pro and con
2) discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of
radar detectors.
3) discussions over which radar detector is best.
4) discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why
rec.autos.sport is not a sports car' group -- everyone would argue
about what constitutes a sports car'.)
5) disputes over whether or not us federal law protects the driver's
right to own and operate a radar detector
6) buy american' discussions
7) clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates
8) cars are terrible
9) what kind of car did maxwell smart drive? when i have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the
commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.
until then, please don't waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw please direct comments and suggestions about this article to: richard welty 518-393-7228 nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of

non-silicone dot-5 fluids are now apparently available -- rpw commonly asked automotive questions
tire questions:
q: what do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean?
a: typically, you will see something like 195 60hr14. the 195 is the
overall width of the tire in millimeters, the tread is usually
narrower. the 60 is the aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the
sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width. our example tire
has a sidewall height of 0.60 195 117 mm. the 14 is the wheel
diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called trx'
tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like
390, which is in millimeters. the r means radial, and the h is a speed
rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly
inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate. common
speed ratings are s (112mph), t (118mph), h (130mph), and v (up to
150mph.)
recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed
rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find
designations like 195 60r14 85h; the 85 indicates the per-tire load
associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous
operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice. what follows is
a table showing a number of load indices' and corresponding maximum
per-tire loads:
load index 50 51 88 89 112 113 145 149 157
max load (kg) 190 195 560 580 1120 1150 2900 3250 4125
note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.
in some cases, the letters p or lt may be found in front of a tire
size; the lt designation indicates light truck, and the p designation
indicates passenger car. if no letter is given, then the application
of the tire is passenger car usage. as far as i know, these letters
only appear in the us market. the lt designation is prinicipally of
interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles. for
the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference
between a tire with a p designation and one with no designation at
all.
if the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.
tires with an ms (mud snow) designation may have their speed rating
reduced by 20 km h (about 12mph.)
there is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,
traction, and treadwear. temperature and traction are graded
a, b, and c (with a the best and c the worst); treadwear is
a numeric rating. these values are of limited value, as they
are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are
thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.
q: my car has tires with a funny size designation: 185 65hr390; can i put
normal tires on the car?
a: your tires are called trx tires; they were devised by michelin.
because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible
with normal tires; michelin used a different diameter wheel for them
so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that
more conventional tires could not be mounted on trx type wheels.)
you will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your
car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on trx wheels, and horribly
dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,
or possibly blow out at high speed.) trx type tires are becoming hard
to find; in addition to michelin, avon makes suitable tires. goodyear
has apparently discontinued their line of trx tires.
q: can i rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side
of my car?
a: car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many
say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a
car is now ok (this group includes michelin and goodyear); others
(for example, pirelli and nokia) will void warranties if such swapping
is done. the best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before
rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.
q: how many snow tires should i buy, and if i buy 2, which end of the
car should i put them on?
a: in short, 4, and both ends. to explain, many drivers in areas that don't
get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow
conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there
are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice. with a rear
wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car
going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car
(a function of the front axle.) in a front wheel drive car, you start,
stop, and turn with the front end. the primary risk of putting the
snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes
while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.
radar detectors and speed limits:
q: why aren't there any comments on radar detectors and speed limits
in this q a posting?
a: because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between
misc.consumers and rec.autos. always start long, tedious, and pointless
flame wars. if you want to talk about either of these topics, please
subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.
safety equipment:
q: do airbags really work?
a: preliminary statistics suggest the following: airbags work much
better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than
airbags alone, and airbags 3 point belts work slightly better than
3 point belts alone. the con to airbags is that some designs tend
to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the
explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but
not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention
of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.
brake questions:
q: do i always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned? midas
always wants to do this.
a: no. there are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing
rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors
more often than is strictly necessary. if the rotors are not warped
warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or
to turn them. note also that some rotors (the rotors on many hondas
are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical
to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,
or badly grooved.
q: they tell me i should downshift when braking to slow my car down. is
this really a good idea?
a: it used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade
prone drum brakes. in modern disc brake equipped cars, use of
downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases
of long, steep downhill runs. otherwise, modern disc brakes are more
than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they
are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.
on the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the usa
still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; i
suggest that before taking a us driver's test, you either 1) learn to
do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a
car with an automatic to take the test.
q: how often should i replace my brake fluid?
a: probably more often than you do. traditional brake fluids tend to
absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake
system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid. dot-3 type
are older fluids; dot-4 and dot-5 are newer specifications. the
principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry
boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling
point is important in older brake fluid. dot-3 fluids have the lowest
wet and dry boiling point requirements ; dot-4 fluids have better
boiling point requirements; and dot-5 fluids have the best boiling
point requirements (but dot-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see
the next q a for more details.) while the requirements imply that
dot-4 fluids are better than dot-3 fluids, there may be specific
cases where a dot-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly
competition applications. otherwise, dot-4 type fluids offer much improved brake pedal feel. replacement once a year is recommended for
dot-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out
fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid
out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.
q: what about dot-5 brake fluids?
a: this breaks down in to two parts. the dot-5 specification looks
excellent for performance, but the first dot-5 fluids were silicone
based. silicone fluids are a tricky proposition. unlike dot-3 and
dot-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all. while this may sound
like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in
such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any
metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring. the water will tend
to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where
most of the corrosion occurs.
because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to
silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly
beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the
brake system when converting to silicone fluids.
two other issues that come up with silicone fluids: 1) they are
difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which
interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they
generally have much higher boiling points than dot-4 fluids, they
do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable
in effect from boiling dot-4 fluids. silicone fluids may make sense
in some street car applications, but they are certainly not
recommended for high performance driving applications, and the
economics are questionable for street use.
i have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the dot-5 standard
that do not contain silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably
compatible with the older dot-3 and dot-4 fluids, but i have little
information at this time.
q: abs is available on some of the cars i'm looking at, but it costs
more. is it worth it?
a: this does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will
be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons. the short answer
is that abs costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally
work better for the average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does
not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),
and may require the unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques
like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.
now for the long answer. abs works by monitering the wheels of the
car, looking for signs of locked brakes. it may or may not be able
be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several
systems on the market.) it cannot detect impending lockup (which is
what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence
of lockup. the sensors used vary; some of the less well designed
sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and
may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original
equipment or oe-equivalent components.
when the sensors detect lockup, the abs system responds by unlocking
the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the
system.) if the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the abs
will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a
sensor existed that could detect impending lockup , then we could
sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is
achieved.) this pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as
the system cycles. the percentage of the time that the brakes are
truly engaged is called the duty cycle'; typically in an abs system
this is about 40 on dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this
duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;
on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that abs will outperform
threshold braking nearly every time. unfortunately, on mud and on
snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes
locked; only audi, of the manufacturers producing abs-equipped cars,
has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the abs system for this
eventuality.
a particularly important feature of abs is that it preserves
steering control. this is the case simply because, if you are
braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the abs will release
the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off
on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.
braking distances will lengthen accordingly.
an important caution: abs cannot exceed the maximum theoretical
braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on
glare ice, don't expect an abs system to help you out very much.
the coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an
abs system in your car.
as far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential
restrictions i've listed above, you have to worry about the
following: 1) parts costs are much higher; the oe master cylinder
for my obscure european sedan lists for 185, but the oe master
cylinder for the abs-equipped version of the same car lists for
over 1000. most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of dot-5
(silicone) brake fluids in abs-equipped vehicles. because of
the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system
components, regular (i suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid
becomes very important.
q: what about this threshold braking business?
a: normally, i'd not put this in the consumers q a, but recent
publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers
in abs-equipped chevy caprices suggests that this section is
needed here -- rpw threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high
performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the stab
the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much
to be prefered. basically, the premise is that tires generate
maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but
just before the wheels lock up entirely. drivers who threshold
brake learn to feel what this threshold' feels like, and learn
to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake
pedal. in many cars, you can feel that you are near the
threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.
in any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're
not very near the threshold.
in a car with abs, often there is a twinge in the pedal just
before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on
the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very
close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better
stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the abs
take over.
recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of
accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with
abs systems. the police departments in question quickly blamed
the new abs systems, but according to autoweek magazine, it now
seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the
involved officers had any recent performance driving training.
there is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing
brake pedal by pump braking', an old and discredited technique
of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to
try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system. if you
think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must
cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least
1 2, so if you cut the 40 duty cycle of an abs system by that
much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.
threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective
and useful technique regardless of whether your car has abs; if
you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at
the pedal will be sufficient.
gas questions:
q: does high octane gasoline help?
a: maybe, maybe not. some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the
engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.
on most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your
car run well. check your owner's manual for details on what your car
needs.
q: my car was made for leaded gasoline. will unleaded gas hurt it?
a: it is possible that unleaded gas may slightly increase valve wear,
although the amoco oil company argues otherwise. the actual increase
in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded
gasolines actually contain very little lead. you should, however,
check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not
actually require leaded gasoline.
q: do fuel treatments help? what kind should i use?
a: some do and some don't. during the winter, it is a good idea to use
dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.
never use an additive containing methanol (sometimes called methyl
alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs
and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.
manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing ethanol (sometimes
called ethyl alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's
manual on your car before using these. most manufacturers consider
10 ethanol acceptable in gasoline. additives with isopropyl alcohol
(isopropanol), and petroleum distillates are fine in fuel injected
cars.
an occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with
fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that
do the same job. some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain
ethanol or methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything
in your gas tank.
there are a small number of particularly good additives; these are
noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work
much, much better. among these are chevron techron, redline sl-1,
wurth lubrimoly ventil sauber', and bg 44k. a bottle of one of these,
once every six months, is highly recommended.
q: what about detergent gasolines?
a: the quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; bmw
has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this
test may advertise that fact. stickers indicating passage of the test
are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations. if such
gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.
beforewarned that while use of bmw approved gasolines will keep a clean
engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.
lubrication questions:
q: what do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?
a: there are several different items encoded. there is a two-letter
code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer
uses in the oil; this looks like se,sf,cd or such. the s codes are
for gasoline engine applications; the c codes are for diesel engine
applications. the second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels
of protection are developed; thus sf is considered better than se,
se is considered better than sd, and so forth.
the more noticeable designation is the oil weight. this is either
a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by
the letter w (e.g., 10w30.) the latter type is much more commonly
used these days, and are the only type that most automobile
manufacturers specify in operators manuals. the first number in the
designation (10w) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;
the w stands for winter'. the second number (30) is the viscosity
of the oil when hot. there is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually
get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter. what
is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity
of a cold 10 weight oil. as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast
as a 10w oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the
viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.
note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not
all 10w oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all
30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot. note also that the
novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has
been reported that with the sole exception of castrol gtx, 10w40 oils
do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time. 10w30,
15w40, and 20w50 oils work very well, though.
q: are quick lube' places any good?
a: some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out
there. let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure
that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on
your wallet at all times.
q: are oil additives like slick-50 or tufoil any good?
a: slick-50 and tufoil are ptfe-based additives. many of these have
come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based
additives that have been around since the early 50's. ptfe is the
chemical name for teflon(tm), a trademark owned by dupont. in general,
auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products. most usenet
responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight
increase of mpg after application, smoother revving) but long term
results (whether ptfe additives are effective after 5k miles) are
debatable. some manufacturers (such as saab) claim that either the
product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes
deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage. some bmw owners
have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of
slick 50 to their cars. this writer has been cautioned by a slick-50
dealer (!) that slick-50 should not be used in japanese motors, as
it may clog the oil return passages in the engine. otherwise, there are
no known reports of damage caused by ptfe additives.
on the other hand, there are satified slick 50 customers in the world.
q: do synthetic oils really work?
a: yes, but. more specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,
but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by
oil manufacturers. auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to
change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your
car. even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change
the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty
as conventional oils.
synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter
entirely; amsoil, redline, and agip are very highly regarded and very
effective. mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.
q: manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.
how often should i change my oil?
a: it depends on how you drive. if your car always (or nearly always)
gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs
down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine. if, however,
you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you
only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up
to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,
perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are
now specifying 7500 mile intervals.) if you don't drive your car
much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change
oil every six months anyway. if you are storing a car during the winter,
then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out
of storage.
misc. questions:
q: my car has a timing belt. i hear that bad things happen when they
break. what's the story?
a: it depends on the internal design of the motor. early ford escorts,
for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but
the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.
some honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.
if no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the
belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent
replacement. ask your dealer or independent mechanic. also, ask if
there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time
(for example, the same ford escorts that suffer valve damage also have
a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,
destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage
as a side effect. replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water
pump can be a costly mistake.)
q: why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it
self destructs when the timing belt breaks?
a: for performance reasons. compromising piston design so that the
valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression
ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are
more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance
oriented vehicles.
q: what causes unintended acceleration?
a: the final report of the national highway, transportation, and safety
administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be
caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the
same time be consistent with the physical evidence. the nhtsa report
goes on to conclude that pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator
is probably the cause.

how do i get a dod number?
if the most frequently asked question in rec.motorcycles is ""what is the
dod?"", then the second most frequently asked question must be ""how do i
get a dod number?"" that is as simple as asking the keeper of the list
(kotl, accept no substitue keepers) for a number. if you're feeling
creative, and your favorite number hasn't been taken already, you can
make a request, subject to kotl approval. (warning, non-numeric, non-
base-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the kotl. not
that you won't get it, but you will pay for it.)
oh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. ask the kotl in e-mail. you'll
just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole
net, and you'll look like a clueless newbie too.
by now you're probably asking ""so who's the kotl already?"". well, as
john sloan notes below, that's about the only real ""secret"" left around
here, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. first, it is not myself,
nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though john was
the original kotl. second, in keeping with the true spirit of unix, the
kotl's first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely
with hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the kotl shares his name with a line-
oriented text utility.) third, he has occasionally been seen posting
messages bestowing new dod numbers (mostly to boneheads with ""weenie
mailers""). fourth, there is reason to suspect the kotl of being a
dead-head. newsflash: a message from the kotl once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically
groveled to the kotl, please keep in mind that the kotl does indeed
work for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting
something done. your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)
days, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two. during such times of
economic activity on the part of the kotl's employers, sending yet
another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it
just makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an
excersize for the reader). if you suspect mailer problems, at least
annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request
was submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think
the kotl memorizes the list?!?). one more thing, the kotl says that its telepathic powers aren't what
they used to be. so provide some information for the list, will ya?
the typical dod list entry contains number, name, state country, e-mail address. for example:
0111:ed (ps: while john mentions below that net access and a bike are the only
requirements for dod membership, that's not strictly true these days, as
there are a number of denizens who lack one or both.)
blaine (dances with bikers) gardner ""denizens of doom"", by bruce tanner (dod 0161) road rider, august 1991, reprinted with bruce's permission there is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal
things that a bunch of bikers do. they discuss motorcycles and
motorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,
helmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve
seats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy,
traffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double
entendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship. they
argue with each other and plan rides together.
the difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that,
although they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each
other face to face. the members of this group live all over the known world
and communicate with each other electronically via computer.
the computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;
the people range from college and university students to high-tech industry
professionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users. currently,
rec.motorcycles (pronounced ""wreck-dot-motorcycles,"" it's the file name for
the group's primary on-line ""meeting place"") carries about 2250 articles per
month; it is read by an estimated 29,000 people. most of the frequent
posters belong to a motorcycle club, the denizens of doom, usually referred
to as the dod.
the dod started when motorcyclist john r. nickerson wrote a couple of
parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes. fellow computer
enthusiast bruce robinson posted these articles under the pen name, ""denizen
of doom."" a while later chuck rogers signed off as dod nr. 0003 keeper of
the flame. bruce was then designated dod nr. 0002, retroactively and, of
course, nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given dod nr. 0001.
the idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules
appealed to many, so john sloan -- dod nr. 0011 -- became keeper of the
list, issuing dod numbers to anyone who wanted one. to date there have been
almost 400 memberships issued to people all over the united states and
canada, as well as australia, new zealand, the united kingdom, france,
germany, norway and finland.
keeper of the list sloan eventually designed a club patch. the initial run
of 300 patches sold out immediately. the profits from this went to the
american motorcycle heritage foundation. another amhf fund raiser --
selling denizens of doom pins to members -- was started by arnie skurow a
few months later. again, the project was successful and the profits were
donated to the foundation. so far, the denizens have contributed over 1500
to the ama museum. a plaque in the name of the denizens of doom now hangs
in the motorcycle heritage museum.
as often as possible, the dod'ers crawl out from behind their crts and go
riding together. it turns out that the two largest concentrations of
dod'ers are centered near denver boulder, colorado, and in california's
""silicon valley."" consequently, two major events are the annual assault on
rollins pass in colorado, and the northern versus southern california
""joust.""
the ride-and-feed is a bike trip over rollins pass, followed by a big
barbecue dinner. the concept for the joust is to have riders from northern
california ride south; riders from southern california to ride north,
meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle. an additional plan
for 1991 is to hold an official denizens of doom homecoming in conjunction
with the ama heritage homecoming in columbus, ohio, in july.
though it's a safe bet the the denizens of doom and their collective
communications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional
motorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in
search of two-wheeled camaraderie, it's a great way for kindred spirits to
get together. long may they flame.
""live to flame -- flame to live"" centerbar this official motto of the denizens of doom refers to the ease with which
you can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do
anything like that face to face. these insults are known as ""flames"";
issuing them is called ""flaming."" flames often start when a member
disagrees with something another member has posted over the network. a
typical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be
something like: ""what an incredibly stupid statement, you spandex-clad
poseur!"" this will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense
of the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding
ability and your cat. the denizens of doom: the saga unfolds by john sloan dod 0011
periodically the question ""what is dod?"" is raised. this is one of
those questions in the same class as ""why is the sky blue?"", ""if there
is a god, why is there so much suffering in the world?"" and ""why do
women inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before they
dump you?"", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,
and philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion
by philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the
halls of academe for generations.
a long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few
minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on
a computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two
machines in the same room in atlanta might route mail to one another
via a system in chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but
who was eventually assigned the dod membership 1) wrote a satire of
the various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and
signed it ""the denizen of doom"". not wishing to identify himself, he
asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time
become dod 2 to post it for him. dod 2, not really giving a whit
about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking
individual, did so. flaming and other amusements followed.
he who would become the holder of dod membership 3 thought this was
the funniest thing he'd seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty
easily amused), so he claimed membership in the denizens of doom
motorcycle club, and started signing his postings with his membership
number.
perhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a
motorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or
make or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized
electronically. it may well be that readers were yearning to become a
part of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a
gestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the
sum of its parts. it could also be that we're all computer nerds who
wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen
to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight
ratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open
minded enough to accept us as members.
in a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, the denizens of doom
motorcycle club was born. a club in which the majority of members have
never met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet
feel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some
of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). a club organized
and run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the
network via electronic news and mail, with a membership mailing list
(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the
same region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating
around the country (organized by dod 9), club patches (organized by 11), and even an mtv-style music video (produced by 47 and
distributed on vhs by 18)!
where will it end? who knows? will the dod start sanctioning races,
placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine
management computers? will the dod organize poker runs where each
participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?
will the dod have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal
room and at least a 386-sized unix system? only time will tell.
the dod has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net
access and a love for motorcycles. to become a member, one need only
ask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few
really good club secrets). new members will receive via email a
membership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which
includes name, state, and email address.
the denizens of doom motorcycle club will live forever (or at least
until next year when we may decided to change the name).

the dod
by the denizen of doom dod 1
welcome one and all to the flamingest, most wonderfullest newsgroup of
all time: wreck.mudder-disciples or is it reak.mudder-disciples? the
names have been changes to protect the guilty (riders) and innocent
(the bikes) alike. if you think you recognize a contorted version of
your name, you don't. it's just your guilt complex working against
you. read 'em and weep.
we tune in on a conversation between some of our heros. terrible
barbarian is extolling the virtues of his hopalonga puff-a-cane to
reverend muck mudgers and stompin fueling-injection:
terrible: this hopalonga is the greatest... beats bmws dead!!
muck: i don't mean to preach, terrible, but lighten up on the bmw
crowd eh? i mean like i like riding my yuka-yuka fudgeo-jammer
11 but what the heck.
stompin: no way, the bmw is it, complete, that's all man.
terrible: nahhhh, you're sounding like heritick ratatnack! hey, at
least he is selling his bmw and uses a hopalonga intercorruptor!
not as good as a puff-a-cane, should have been called a
woosh-a-stream.
stompin: you mean wee-stream.
terrible: waddya going to do? call in reinforcements???
stompin: yehh man. here comes arlow scarecrow and high tech. let's see
what they say, eh?
muck: now men, let's try to be civil about this.
high tech: hi, i'm a 9 and the bmw is the greatest.
arlow: other than my b.t. i love my bmw!
terrible: b.t.???
arlow: burley thumpison, the greatest all american ride you can own.
muck: ahhh, look, you're making terrible gag.
terrible: what does bmw stand for anyway???
muck, arlow, high: beats me, wilhelm.
terrible: actually, my name is terrible. hmmm, i don't know either.
muck: say, here comes chunky bear.
chunky: hey, hey, hey! smarter than your average bear!
terrible: hey, didn't you drop your bmw???
chunky: all right eh, a little booboo, but i left him behind. i mean
even villy ogle flamed me for that!
muck: it's okay, we all makes mistakes.
out of the blue the west coasters arrive, led by tread orange with
dill snorkssy, heritick ratatnack, buck garnish, snob rasseller and
the perenial favorite: hooter boobin brush!
heritick: heya terrible, how's yer front to back bias?
terrible: not bad, sold yer bmw?
heritick: nahhh.
hooter: hoot, hoot.
buck: nice tree hooter, how'd ya get up there?
hooter: carbujectors from hell!!!
muck: what's a carbujector?
hooter: well, it ain't made of alumican!!! made by tilloslert!!
muck: ahh, come on down, we aren't going to flame ya, honest!!
dill: well, where do we race?
snob: you know, chunky, we know about about your drop and well, don't
ride!
muck: no! no! quiet!
tread: bmw's are the greatest in my supreme level headed opinion.
they even have luggage made by sourkraut!
high: my 9 too!
terrible, heritick, dill, buck: nahhhhh!!!
stompin, tread, high, chunky, snob: yesss yessssss!!!
before this issue could be resolved the hopalonga crew called up more
cohorts from the local area including polyanna stirrup and the
infamous booster robiksen on his cavortin!
polyanna: well, men, the real bikers use stirrups on their bikes like
i use on my hopalonga evening-bird special. helpful for getting
it up on the ole ventral stand!
terrible: hopalonga's are great like polyanna says and yuka-yuka's and
sumarikis and kersnapis are good too!
booster: i hate cavortin.
all: we know, we know.
booster: i love cavortin.
all: we know we know.
muck: well, what about mucho guzlers and lepurras?
snob, tread: nawwwwww.
muck: what about a tridump?
terrible: isn't that a chewing gum?
muck: auggggg, waddda about a pluck-a-kity?
heritick: heyya muck, you tryin' to call up the demon rider himself?
muck: no, no. there is more to mudder-disciples than arguing about make.
two more riders zoom in, in the form of pill turret and phalanx lifter.
pill: out with dorsal stands and ventral stands forever.
phalanx: hey, i don't know about that.
and now even more west coasters pour in.
road o'noblin: hopalonga's are the greatest!
maulled beerstein: may you sit on a bikejector!
suddenly more people arrived from the great dark nurth:
kite lanolin: hey, bmw's are great, men.
robo-nickie: i prefer motorcycle to robot transformers, personally.
more riders from the west coast come into the discussion:
aviator sourgas: get a burley-thumpison with a belted-rigged frame.
guess gasket: go with a bmw or burley-thumpison.
with a roar and a screech the latest mudder-disciple thundered in. it
was none other that clean bikata on her hopalonga cabammerxorn.
clean: like look, hopalonga are it but only cabammerxorns.
muck: why??
clean: well, like it's gotta be a 6-banger or nothin.
muck: but i only have a 4-banger.
clean: no good!
chunky: sob, some of us only have 2-bangers!
clean: inferior!
stompin: hey, look, here's proof bmw's are better. the bimmer-boys
burst into song: (singing) beemer babe, beemer babe give me a
thrill...
road, terrible, polyanna, maulled, dill etc.: wadddoes bmw stand for?
heritick, stompin, snob, chunky, tread, kite, high, arlow: beat's me,
wilhem!
road, terrible, polyanna, maulled, dill etc.: oh, don't you mean bmw?
and so the ensuing argument goes until the skies clouded over and the
thunder roared and the greatest mudder-disciple (g.m.d.) of them all
boomed out.
g.m.d.: enough of your bickering! you are doomed to riding
bigot suction powered mini-trikes for your childish actions.
all: no, no, no!!! puhlease.
does this mean that all of the wreck.mudder-disciples will be riding
mini-trikes? are our arguing heros doomed? tune in next week for the
next gut wretching episode of ""the yearning and riderless"" with its
ever increasing cast of characters. where all technical problems will
be flamed over until well done. next week's episode will answer the
question of: ""to helmet or not to helmet"" will be aired, this is heady
material and viewer discretion is advised.
script for the denizens of doom anthem video
by jonathan e. quist dod 94 scene: a sterile engineering office. a lone figure, whom we'll call
chuck, stands by a printer output bin, wearing a white cdc lab coat,
with 5 mechanical pencils in a pocket protector. (editor's note: for some reason a great deal of amusement was had at
the first annual dod uni-coastal ironhorse ride joust by denizens
referring to each other as ""chuck"". i guess you had to be there. i
wasn't.)
chuck: i didn't want to be a software systems analyst,
cow-towing to the whims of a machine, and saying yessir, nosir,
may-i-have-another-sir. my mother made me do it. i wanted
to live a man's life, music slowly builds in background riding nortons and triumphs through the highest mountain passes
and the deepest valleys,
living the life of a motorcyclist;
doing donuts and evading the police;
terrorizing old ladies and raping small children;
eating small dogs for tea (and large dogs for dinner). in short,
i want to be a denizen! chuck rips off his lab coat, revealing black leather jacket (with
fringe), boots, and cap. scene simultaneously changes to the top of
an obviously assaulted rollins pass. a small throng of hell's angels
sit on their harleys in the near background, gunning their engines,
showering lookers-on with nails as they turn donuts, and leaking oil
on the tarmac. chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed fat
boy. chuck sings to the tune of ""the lumberjack song"" :
i'm a denizen and i'm okay,
i flame all night and i ride all day. hell's angels echo chorus, surprisingly heavy on tenors :
he's a denizen and he's okay,
he flames all night and he rides all day.
i ride my bike;
i eat my lunch;
i go to the lavat'ry.
on wednesdays i ride skyline,
running children down with glee. chorus :
he rides his bike;
he eats his lunch;
he goes to the lavat'ry.
on wednesdays he rides skyline,
running children down with glee. chorus refrain :
'cause he's a denizen...
i ride real fast,
my name is chuck,
it somehow seems to fit.
i over-rate the worst bad f ck,
but like a real good sh t.
oh, i'm a denizen and i'm okay!
i flame all night and i ride all day. chorus refrain :
oh, he's a denizen...
i wear high heels
and bright pink shorts,
full leathers and a bra.
i wish i rode a harley,
just like my dear mama. chorus refrain why you have to be killed.
well, the first thing you have to understand (just in case you managed
to read this far, and still not figure it out) is that the dod started
as a joke. and in the words of one denizen, it intends to remain one.
sometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: ""what does dod
stand for? it's not the department of defense is it?"" naturally, a
denizen who had watched the movie ""top gun"" a few times too many rose
to the occasion and replied:
""that's classified, we could tell you, but then we'd have to kill you.""
and the rest is history.
a variation on the ""security"" theme is to supply disinformation about
what dod stands for. notable contributions (and contributers, where
known) include:
daughters of democracy (dod 23) doers of donuts
dancers of despair (dod 9) debasers of daughters
dickweeds of denver driveway of death
debauchers of donuts dumpers of dirtbikes
note that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be
limited only by the contents of one's imagination or dictionary file.
the rec.moto.photo archive
first a bit of history, this all started with ilana stern and chuck
rogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. many copies were made,
and several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in
unknown locations. then bruce tanner decided that it would be appropriate
for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. bruce has not
only provided the disk space and ftp e-mail access, but he has taken
the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.
not only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk
at their motorcycles. a few non-photo files are available from the
server too, they include the dod membership list, the dod yellow pages,
the general rec.motorcycles faq, and this faq posting.
here are a couple of excerpts from from messages bruce posted about how
to use the archive. via ftp:
cerritos.edu 130.150.200.21 via e-mail:
the address is the commands are given in the body of the
message. the current commands are dir and send, given one per line. the
arguments to the commands are vms style file specifications. for
rec.moto.photo the file spec is dod file. for example, you can send:
dir dod send dod bruce tanner.gif
send dod dodframe.ps
and you'll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts
of bruce tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ascii.
oh, wildcards ( ) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to
the next whole file) are send. a 'send dod .gif' would send 150 files of
50k each; not a good idea.
bruce tanner (213) 860-2451 x 596 cerritos college norwalk, ca cerritos!tanner a couple of comments: bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so
why not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful?
second, since bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind
of you to access it after normal working hours (california time).
patches? what patches?
you may have heard mention of various dod trinkets such as patches pins. and your reaction was probably: ""i want!"", or ""that's sick!"", or
perhaps ""that's sick! i want!""
well, there's some good news and some bad news. the good news is that
there's been an amazing variety of dod-labeled widgets created. the bad
news is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of them. this isn't
because of any ""exclusivity"" attempt, but simply because there is no
""dod store"" that keeps a stock. all of the creations have been done by
individual denizens out of their own pockets. the typical procedure is
someone says ""i'm thinking of having a dod frammitz made, they'll cost xx.xx, with xx.xx going to the ama museum. anyone want one?"" then
orders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the
pre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). so if you want a
dod doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. or
produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all
this is anarchy in action.
here's a possibly incomplete list of known dod merchandise (and
perpetrators). patches (dod 11), pins (dod 99), stickers (dod 99),
motorcycle license plate frames (dod 216), t-shirts (dod 99), polo shirts
(dod 122), zippo lighters (dod 99) ltf ftl , belt buckles (dod 99), and
patches (dod 99) a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by
popular demand .
all ""profits"" have been donated to the american motorcyclist association
motorcycle heritage museum. as of june 1992, over 5500 dollars has been
contributed to the museum fund by the dod. if you visit the museum,
you'll see a large plaque on the founders' wall in the name of ""denizens
of doom, usenet, the world"", complete with a dod pin.
here's a letter from the ama to the dod regarding our contributions. newsgroups: rec.motorcycles from: arnie skurow subject: a letter from the motorcycle heritage museum date: mon, 13 apr 1992 11:04:58 gmt
i received the following letter from jim rogers, director of the museum,
the other day.
""dear arnie and all members of the denizens of doom:
congratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the
denizens of doom! with your recent donation, the total amount donated is
now 5,500. on behalf of the amhf, please extend my heartfeld gratitude
to all the membership of the denizens. the club's new plaque is presently
being prepared. of course, everyone is invited to come to the museum to
see the plaque that will be installed in our founders foyer. by the way,
i will personally mount a denizens club pin on the plaque. again, thank
you for all your support, which means so much to the foundation, the
museum, and the fulfillment of its goals.
sincerely,
jim rogers, d.o.d. 0395
director
p.s. please post on your computer bulletin board.""
as you all know, even though the letter was addressed to me personally,
it was meant for all of you who purchased dod goodies that made this
amount possible.

the rules, regulations, bylaws of the denizens of doom motorcycle club
from time to time there is some mention, discussion, or flame about the
rules of the dod. in order to fan the flames, here is the complete text
of the rules governing the dod.
rule 1. there are no rules.
rule 0. go ride.
other rec.motorcycles information resources.
there are several general rec.motorcycles resources that may or may not
have anything to do with the dod. most are posted on a regular basis,

(loki jorgenson has provided an archive site
for motorcycle and accessory reviews, here's an excerpt from his
periodic announcement. the rec.motorcycles.reviews archives (and world famous llama
emporium) contains a veritable plethora (tm) of bike (and accessories)
reviews, written by rec.moto readers based on their own experiences.
these invaluable gems of opinion (highly valued for their potential to
reduce noise on the list) can be accessed via anonymous ftp, email
server or by personal request:
anonymous ftp: ftp.physics.mcgill.ca (132.206.9.13)
under ftp pub dod
email archive server: review submissions questions: note: there is a difference in the addresses for review submission
and using the email archive server (ie. an ""ftp."").
to get started with the email server, send an email message with a line
containing only ""send help"".
note: if your return address appears like
domain!subdomain!host!username
in your mail header, include a line like (or something similar)
path if you are interested in submitting a review of a bike that you
already own(ed), please do! there is a template of the format that the
reviews are kept in (more or less) available at the archive site .
for those who have internet access but are unsure of how anonymous
ftp works, an example script is available on request. reviews of any motorcycle related accessory or widget are welcome too.
updated stats rec.motorcycles rides info
some of the info cited above in various places tends to be a moving
target. rather than trying to catch every occurence, i'm just sticking
the latest info down here.
estimated rec.motorcycles readership: 35k news.groups approximate dod membership: 975 kotl dod contributions to the american motorcyclist association motorcycle
heritage museum. over 5500 arnie organized (?) rides:
summer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the joust in its third
year, and the ride feed going strong, but without the rollins pass
trip due to the collapse of a tunnel. the east coast denizens got
together for the right coast ride (rcr), with bikers from as far north
as nh, and as far south as fl meeting in the blueridge mountains of
north carolina. the pacific northwest crew organized the first great
pacific northwest dryside gather (gpndg), another successful excuse for
riding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have
come to know so well. thanks to ed green for the above addition. also worth mentioning are: the first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the
moab canyonlands area of southern utah. riders from 5 states showed up,
riding everything from monster bmws to itty-bitty xrs to almost-legal
2-strokes. and though it's not an ""official"" (as if anything could be
official with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races
in steamboat springs, colorado always provides a good excuse for netters
to gather. there's also been the occasional labor day gather in utah.
european denizens have staged some gathers too. (your ad here,
reasonable rates!)

103117.eml,rec.motorcycles,"you got off cheap. my sister's ex-boyfriend was such an incessant pain
in the ass about wanting to ride my bikes (no way, jose) that i
finally took him to lindner's bmw in new canaan, ct last fall where
i had seen a nice, used k100rs in perfect condition. after telling
everyone in the shop his norton war stories from fifteen years ago,
signing the liability waiver, and getting his pre-flight, off he went...
well, not quite. i walked out of a pizza shop up the street,
feeling good about myself (made my sister's boyfriend happy and got
the persistent wanker off my ass for good), heard the horrendous
racket of an engine tortured to its red line and then a crash. i
saw people running towards the obvious source of the disturbance...
jeff laying under the bmw with the rear wheel spinning wildly and
someone groping for the kill switch. i stared in disbelief with
a slice hanging out of my mouth as matty, the shop manager, slid
up beside me and asked, ""friend of yours, steve?"". ""shit, matty,
it could have been worse. that could been my flhs!""
jeff hadn't made it 10 inches. witnesses said he lifted his feet
before letting out the clutch and gravity got the best of him.
jeff claimed that the clutch didn't engage. matty was quick.
while jeff was still stuttering in embarrassed shock he managed
to snatch jeff's credit card for a quick imprint and signature. twenty
minutes later, when jeff's color had paled to a flush, matty
presented him with an estimate of 580 for a busted right mirror
and a hairline crack in the fairing. that was for fixing the crack
and masking the damaged area, not a new fairing. or he could buy the
bike.
i'm not sure what happened later as my sister split up with jeff shortly
afterwards (to hook up with another piece of work) except that matty
told me he ran the charge through in december and that it went
uncontested.

a few years ago. while i was waiting my turn to state my case and
plea of why i was going 75 in a 55 in my cage, i had the opportunity
to listen to some of the ""creative excuses"" offered the judge by others.
after listening to a number of ""well, i was passing a very slow truck
that suddenly speed up"" versions, i decided that the judge had heard
just about every story in the book and then some. he was less than
impressed with any of them.
this young, rather burley looking guy, had his docket read by a
rather drill sargent looking ohio state highyway patrol trooper.
he was clocked riding a motorcycle at a speed of 110 mph in a 55 mph
zone. it was also noted that the defendant (motorcycle rider) had
alcohol on his breath, but was not cited for this offence.
the judge looked over his half glasses purched on the end of his nose
and said in his sternest voice: ""well son, those are some pretty
fast speeds to be riding a motorcycle. what do you have to say for
your self?""
""well sir"", meekly the defenant replied, ""i just was over to my
buddys and we had a couple of beers and i was on my way home.""
he offered nothing more or less. just had a couple of beers and
was doing 110 mph on his way home.
the judge moved by the simplicity of the response, fined him the
maximum in this case (plus court costs of course) and ordered him
to attend remedial drivers training school.

nice to hear from you again!
ouch. :-) this brings to mind one of the recommendations in the
hurt study. because the rear of the gas tank is in close proximity
to highly prized and easily damaged anatomy, hurt et al recommended
that manufacturers build the tank so as to reduce the, er, step function
provided when the rider's body slides off of the seat and onto the
gas tank in the unfortunate event that the bike stops suddenly and the
rider doesn't. i think it's really inspiring how the manufacturers
have taken this advice to heart in their design of bikes like the
cbr900rr and the gts1000a.

103171.eml,rec.motorcycles,"can you beat this ticket? personally, i think it's your duty as a citizen
to make it as much trouble as possible for them, so maybe they'll give up
and leave us alone someday soon.
the cop was certainly within his legal rights to nail you by guessing
your speed. mr. brown (the author of fight your ticket) mentions an
oakland judge who convicted a speeder ""on the officer's testimony that
the driver's car sounded like it was being driven at an excessive speed.""
you can pay off the state and your insurance company, or you can
take it to court and be creative. personally, i've never won that way
or seen anyone win, but the judge always listens politely. and i haven't
seen that many attempts.
you could try the argument that since bikes are shorter than the
cars whose speed the nice officer is accustomed to guessing, they therefore
appear to be further away, and so their speed appears to be greater than
it actually is. i left out a step or two, but you get the idea. if you
can make it convincing, theoretically you're supposed to win.
i've never tried proving the cop was mistaken. i did get to see
some other poor biker try it. he was mixing up various facts like
the maximum acceleration of a (cop) car, and the distance at which
the cop had been pacing him, and end up demonstrating that he couldn't
possibly have been going as fast as the cop had suggested. he'd
brought diagrams and a calculator. he was prepared. he lost. keep
in mind cops do this all the time, and their word is better than yours.
maybe, though, they don't guess how fast bikes are going all the time.
besides, this guy didn't speak english very well, and ended up absolutely
confounding the judge, the cop, and everyone else in the room who'd been
recently criminalized by some twit with a gun and a quota.
ahem. ok, i'm better now. maybe he'd have won had his presentation

the windshield should remain up at all times, and it looks like they've made
it a pain to put it down anyway, from what he says. to be fair, i do admit

notice how ed picked on the more insignificant (the lower case part) of the
two parts of the statement. besides, around here it is quite rare to see
bikers wear goggles on the street. it's either full face with shield, or
open face with either nothing or aviator sunglasses. my experience of
bicycling with contact lenses and sunglasses says that non-wraparound
sunglasses do almost nothing to keep the crap out of ones eyes.
ok, ok, fine, whatever you say, but lets make some attmept to stick to the
point. i've been out on the road where i had to stop every half hour to clean
my shield there were so many bugs (and my jacket would be a blood-splattered
mess) and i'd see guys with shorty helmets, no goggles, long beards and tight
t-shirts merrily cruising along on bikes with no windscreens. lets be really
specific this time, so that even ed understands. does anbody think that
splattering bugs with one's face is fun, or are there other reasons to do it?
image? laziness? to make a point about freedom of bug splattering?

that may be pushing my limit. advantages include the fact
that i can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates
the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.
2) buy some kind of leather jacket. i like a few of the new
hein-gericke firstgear line, however they may be a bit pricey
unless i can work some sort of deal. advantages of leather
are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose
value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper
than upper aerostich.
requirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other
layers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i'd prefer a zip-out
lining, it must have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows,
shoulders, forearms, possibly back kidney protection, etc.), a
reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would
be a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below
freezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.

being a fairly experienced bmw and mz-mechanic, i just don't know what to
think about my honda.
she was using too much oil for the last 5000 km (on my trip to daytona bike
week this spring), and all of a sudden, she trailed smoke like hell and
was running only on one cylinder.
i towed the bike home and took it apart, but everything looks in perfect
working order. no cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look
very clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. all
still within factory specs. the only thing i could find, however, was a
slightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder (the one with the problem),
but it is still way below the wear-limit given in the clymer-manual for
this bike.
any syggestions??? what else could cause my problem??? do i have to hone
the cylinder walls (make them a little rougher in a criss-cross-pattern) in
order to get better breaking in of my new rings??? won't that increase the
wear of my pistons??

i am selling my trusty husky... hopefully to buy a husaberg... this is
a very good dirt bike and has been maintained perfectly. i never had
any problems with it.
it's a four stroke, 4 valves, liquid cooled engine. it is heavier than
a 250 2 stroke but still lighter than a honda xr600 and has a lot better
suspension (ohlins shock, husky fork) than the xr. for the casual or non
competitive rider, the engine is much better than any two stroke.
you can easily lug up hills and blast through trails with minimum gear
changes.
the 1992 ignition and the carefully tuned carburation makes this bike
very easy to start (starts of first kick when cold or hot). there is a
custom made carbon kevlar (light 1 pound) wrap around skid plate to protect
the engine cases and the water pump. the steering angle has been reduced
by 2 degree to increase steering quickness. this with the suspension tune-up
by phil douglas of aftershock (multiple time isde rider) gives it a better
ride than most bike: plush suspension, responsive steering with no head shake.
so if it is such a good bike why sell it???? gee, i want to buy a husaberg,

press release
to:: all bmw riders
subject:: rally time is here
from:: bmw club of northern california
bmw 49'er rally, may 27-31 (u.s. memorial day weekend)
san francisco bay area - 20th annual bmw 49'er rally, sponsored by
the bmw club of northern califronia, will be held at the quincy,
california fairgrounds, from may 27-31, 1993
included in the 42 pre-registration fee, 47 at gate, are 4 star
camping, field events and trophies, two dinners, rally pin, door prizes,
poker run, vendor displays, fun run, english trials, and live music playing
throughout the weekend. plus extras like hot showers, tours, a concourse
d'elegance and more.
this is first time in the 49'er rally's 20-year history that the
event is being held in quincy. and according to pat gardner, rally chairman,
""the 49'er rally's continuing growth and the need for a larger and more
complete facility led us to quincy. plus we can get there on either of our
two most favrite highways- highway 70, which goes through the feather river
canyon, or up from the south via the northernmost part of the gold country's
highway 49.""
day passes will not be available and non-bmw rider must be a
pre-registered guest of a bmw rider.
the quincy fairgrounds is located on california state highway 70 89,
two miles south of downtown quincy.
for pre-registration forms and additional information, write doug
hubbard, bmw club of northern california, 41236 norman court, fremont, ca
94539, or telephone (510) 651-2195
additional notes::
this is a not for profit event and riders do get their monies worth.
whether you've ever attended a rally before or not this is the one
to make. the only problem has been that there are so
many activities that attendees have to choose one over another.
quincy is a beautiful campground, lots of grass and little dust.
for folks who have been to previous 49'er rallies at mariposa,
quincy has lots of space, all of it flat so room is not a problem.
there are buildings and such available if there is a change in the weather.
also the people of quincy are going all out to welcome us.
registration will begin on thursday. of course there are always early
arrivals who will show up monday or tuesday. the registration fee pays
for camping thursday through monday (5 days). there will be a tour friday
with the main events beginning saturday. sunday evening will be the
awards ceremony.
for members of the various clubs, club awards will be based on
registration declaration of affilitation. there will of course
be the usual awards for oldest male and female rider and youngest rider ( they get cheater permits at 15 .
and greatest distance, one up two up and all the usual things."

switching back was really bad...

2) with a faceplate, it's still bloody windy... with the shoei, i normally
ignore the face shield until i get up to about 30ish... with this one,
taxiing to the end of the driveway was too smegging much wind.
the question for the day is re: passenger helmets, if you don't know for
certain who's gonna ride with you (like say you meet them at a .... church
meeting, yeah, that's the ticket)... what are some guidelines? should i just
pick up another shoei in my size to have a backup helmet (xl), or should i

that they were or are looking to steal the bike. in my case, i
had a faded cover stolen off a bmw r100rs that was stashed in an

decided the beemer wasn't worth stealing, but did try the next night to
steal a honda hurricane 600 parked in the next apartment building.

what you want are meguiar's mirror glaze plastic polish and plastic
cleaner. they are very mild abrasives meant to remove scratches from
plastic. for fine scratches just use the polish, for bigger ones start
with the cleaner and finish with the polish. the stuff is 5-8 bucks per
bottle at most auto or motorcycle parts stores. don't choke over the

battle at about 100mph. what happened at the end? the guy (who is
being relentless chased down box the cage with the disco lights)
slows a couple of times to taunt the cop. after blowing a few stop
signs and making car jump to the side, he goes up a dead end street.
the kat, although not the latest machine, is still a high performance
machine and he slams on the brakes. of couse, we all know that cages,
especially the ones with the disco lights, can't stop as fast as our
high performance machines. so what happens?... the cage plows into the
kat.

collided with a car head on at 140 mph, the kawasaki team colors
still looked good!!! just a few scratches, like no front end....

back in my youth (ahem) the wiffy and moi purchased a gadget which heated up
water from a 12v source. it was for car use but we thought we'd try it on my

above 7000. any lower and the motor would die from lack of electron movement.
it made for interesting cups of coffee, anyhow. we would plot routes that
contained straights of over three miles so that we had sufficient time to
get the water to boiling point. this is sometimes difficult in england.

btw, anyone have any idea on the contenders for the o's fifth starter?
it's pretty much set that sutcliffe, mussina, mcdonald and rhodes are the
first four in the rotation.

if we had a stadium with 80,000 seats. but unfortunely the yards (a
definitely excellent ballpark) only holds like 45,000 with 275 sro spots.
ticket sales for the entire year is moving fast. bleacher seats are almost
gone for every game this year. it's a extremely likelyhood that the o's
could sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for
most of the year like '89).
on another front, the sale of the orioles to anyone is likely to be
forced upon eli jacobs who is major debt apparently. maybe we can get an
owner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter.
fernando has made the o's as the fifth starter. the o's pitching
staff looks pretty good. sutcliffe, mussina, mcdonald, rhodes, and fernando.

would be lopez in there. but they do have others worth playing, at
least in their opinion. and i happen to agree.
i can believe that. i'm a newbie here, so i'll take your word. but
alomar is a fine defensive catcher, which was my statement above.
that is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age, as long
as they feel he can also hit a bit. lopez does not have such a
consensus about his defensive prowess, and imho that is enough to
give him that dreaded ""seasoning"".
sorry. new. don't know nichols' law. don't believe in catchers'
era. but i am interested in pitchers' eras with different catchers.
any info on that?
in other words, we know more than they do, so the only logic behind
a different decision than we would make must be financial. i presume
we feel this way about other franchises than atlanta, no?

well, i can't cite anyone's ethical rectitude because i don't know
what it means. :)
but again, if it makes organizational sense, then so be it. baseball
is a business, and if there is a solid business reason for keeping
lopez on the farm then that's what the braves should do.
i happen to believe that it's a baseball decision. while you from
your armchair may disagee, i don't. i think there is a lot of
evidence to suggest the decision they made. i predicted it among
large guffaws from several at the start of spring training. i
think it is a very normal decision to have made. it is certainly
more reversible than to have started lopez in the bigs and have
released one of their catchers. sure, it may be conservative. it
may also be logical. i don't know what ethics have to do with it.

this is what jackson looked like in 88-91, with everything converted
to a neutral park, on the basis of run production. his equivalent
average started at .253 in 88, was up to .274 in 89 and 286 in 90. so
let us say he had established, in his last two seasons, a .280 level
of play.
that is good. very good, in fact. but it probably doesn't make the top
ten in the league. the 10th best eqa in the al in 1992 was dave
winfield's .296; thomas was first at .350. first in the nl was bonds,
an incroyable .378; tenth was bip roberts, .297. but .280 is better
than any season in the past five years by joe carter; it is about what
mattingly had in 1988 (.285); what felix jose had the last two years;
just ahead of time raines' five-year average; better than ryan
klesko's mles.
he got more attention from the media than was warranted from his
baseball playing, though; his hype was a lot better than his hitting.
that is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated. the
media would have you beleive he was a great hitter. i think he was a
good, maybe very good hitter. he was imo, something like the 30th best
hitter in the majors.
clay d."
102621.eml,rec.sport.baseball,"the same bill james? why do you say that? it sounds like you're suggesting
bill james had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. au contraire;
he was fairly critical of him after his roy campaign, noting that he wasn't
all-world as a catcher or a hitter. he called him basically average when
everyone else in the media was predicting the next johnny bench or roy
campanella.
which reports are those?
i like hernandez a lot, but if piazza can catch the ball, you've gotta play
him imho. he's a much better hitter, although hernandez isn't a bad hitter.
right now, it sounds like piazza will catch most of the time and hernandez
will be candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. as long as they
play up to their abilities, the dodgers could have a very good catching
tandem.
i think both are overrated defensively (see nichols' law of catcher
defense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from
your viewpoint or mine. about the only tangible thing we can look at is
opponent's sb , and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners.
catchers era is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases.
as for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big
bat', i disagree here too. about the only chink in the braves' armor is that
they're weak offensively at several positions (cf, c, 2b, ss if belliard
plays, 1b unless bream and hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak
defensively if blauser plays. i'd like to see the braves give at least one of
mel nieves, javy lopez or chipper jones a shot, but much like the talent-rich
jays of recent years they'll be conservative and stick with what they have.
i'm not saying that's wrong, just conservative.

prospects and the relationship between age, career length, mvps and hall of
fame members? it was part of their preseason special. basically, they looked
at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or abs) by the time they
were 24, and noticed some interesting things.
for starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of mvps in
the history of the game. they also found out such players represented the
majority of the players in the hall of fame. the kicker, though, was that
they actually did some number-crunching and found that such players' careers
lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. they also
found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and
produced over twice the raw totals (hrs, etc) of the other players. the first
group outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw ba, and blew away
the second group in such categories as hrs, 2bs, rbis, etc.

a little of the dodger logo.
many teams have opted for a return to a previous style
of uniform, or at least uniforms that look more traditional.
(phillies, reds, expos, white sox, padres, etc.) and the once
bright colors have been altered to gray. the trend has also
seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the

lefebvre pinch hit for rick wilkins with tommy shields! how can you do that
just because of the lefty-righty thing, too much is made of that. wilkins is
twice the hitter that shields is. then the next batter was jose vizcaino, one
of the weakest hitters i have ever seen, and who had looked terrible at bat all
day, and lefebre let him hit, while may still sat the bench. i think even arnie

102668.eml,rec.sport.baseball,"yes. but this is irrelevant . you're talking about averages, when we
have lots of information about this player in particular to base our
decisions on.
i might as well say ""we know that very, very few people are more than 7 feet
tall, so chances are that manute bol is really only 6 foot 4.""
why isn't lopez likely to hit that well? he hit that well last year (after
adjusting his stats for park and league and such); he hit better (on an
absolute scale) than olson or berryhill did. by a lot.
as for rushing... if there really is a qualitative difference between the
minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and i don't
believe there is), then wouldn't you rather waste lopez's 22-year old good
season than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent
season? the sooner you get him acclimated, the more of his prime you get to
use.
the point was not that 17 ab is a significant sample, but rather that he
hadn't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager
to question whether his minor league numbers were for real, or to send him
down ""until he gets warmed up"".
most players are never ready for the bigs. what does this have to do
with javy lopez?
see above.
but i could apply the same reasoning to frank thomas or barry bonds. most
players aren't that good, so they probably won't be that good this year
either.
and demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble.
not superstars, not stars, not even good players. maybe average, if we're
being charitable.
ummm. justice is a very fine hitter. pendleton might have another big year
in his bat, but he might also spend the season in hamstring hell. gant is a
big question mark. the bream hunter platoon is decent (not excellent) and
has rotten obp or slg (depending on who's in). blauser is a very valuable
bat... for a shortstop.
wanna bet? the difference between lopez's bat and olson berryhill could be
20 or 30 runs over the course of the season. given a choice between a player
with experience and a player who can play, i'll take the latter every time.
just like keith mitchell did?
that was me, and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they
really don't understand how good lopez is, or overvalue experience,
or some combination of the two. i think my interpretation was more
flattering to the organization. well-argued but inflammatory reply deleted. david m. tate (i do not know what it is about you that closes

102669.eml,rec.sport.baseball,"catcher is their weakest position, with the possible exception of second base.
they have a chance to simultaneously replace their biggest offensive problem
spot with a well-above-average offensive player and acclimate a highly
promising potential star with no pressure on him to carry the team, and they
want to play olson and berryhill instead?!
""a catcher's defensive reputation will be inversely proportional to his
recent offensive level of performance."" thus, mickey tettleton goes (in
the media) from being a no-hit defensive whiz to a slugging thumb-finger
in two short years. the rule doesn't apply to perceived ""superstars"", who
get the gold glove offensive transfer effect instead. greg olson is probably
considered to be a good defensive catcher precisely because he can't hit.
aren't they the same thing?
either that or just stupidity.
of course.
one could make the same sort of argument in other cases. pete rose, in
pursuing ty cobb's record, was a huge gate attraction (and national media
magnet). the reds made a lot of money off that; they also wasted the prime
of eric davis. that may be ""good business"", but that doesn't mean i don't
loathe them for it.

does not improve at aaa, isn't that a sign that maybe he doesn't
belong in the bigs?
now, keith mitchell. as i recall (no stat books handy - surprise!)
he jumped from aa to atlanta in 1991. he did so well that he was
returned to the minors, where he didn't do very well at all. now
his career is in jeopardy. so how does he fit in with your
point. good mle's in aa. moved him right to the big club. now
he's one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball.

imo, given the various ages of the braves and reds this season,
that the braves will be closer to their peak, while the reds
have slightly passed their peak.
also, if you're going to compare braves and yankees, a more appropriate
comparison to the '93 braves might be the '23 yankees.

102693.eml,rec.sport.baseball,"1) back at the beginning of spring training, i though
lopez would make the squad easily. olson was still
recovering from his late-season injury (knee, i believe),
and there were questions as to whether he would be
able to play before june. and then berryhill was dinged up.
i was looking forward to this, because i believe that lopez
can hit and field the position. before last season, he was
the braves ""defensive catcher"" prospect, while brian deak was
the braves ""offensive catcher"" prospect. besides, olson
and berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard
box, and don't walk enough to be useful.
but olson recovered quickly, berryhill recovered, and the braves went
with the two vets. i still say that if one of those two had been down
at the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back.
2) there is a certain logic to keeping olson and berryhill around.
after all, ml catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and
tear. there are teams out there without one average ml catcher
(california and seattle come to mind). certainly, trying to
move olson or berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.
plus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn't
tiddleywinks either (i think olson's at about 800,000, berryhill
at 450,000, but that's only what i recall).
3) yes, i think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to
play in this also. what is it, that 5 6 of the 2 year players
aren't eligible for arbitration? only the 1 6 that were on the roster
the longest are eligible? of course, the system may change,
but the extent of that change is not yet known. from a business
standpoint, it may make sense to keep lopez down until june the
first time olson berryhill go on the dl.
4) i am still disappointed that lopez isn't on the team.
i still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the braves,
and the truth is that i'd rather see our best team on the field,
which, imo, includes lopez.
of course,today we play the cubs. hopefully, we won't need him. ;)
as for the schuerholz cox conversation, i imagine it went
like this: (remember, they've both been gm's)
(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)
cox: ok, we've sent jones down. his fielding could be a
little smoother. besides, blauser can hit ok and his fielding
is better than it used to be.
schuerholz: well, we'll have to send nieves down too. deion
just won't sign that baseball only contract. we can't count
on him in october, so we have to keep nixon around for the
defense. besides, gorman's not ready to give up on
billy hatcher yet. once hatcher's gone and deion signs,
we can move nixon for frankie rodriguez. that ought to
give us some pitching depth in 1995.
cox: yep, that'll be nice. too bad deion won't sign.
ok, i'll look for nieves when justice starts having
berry-berry...er, back problems again. now, what about
klesko?
schuerholz: well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil
for bream. if we keep klesko, we either lose the money
or cabrera. i keep dangling sid in front of dal maxwell,
but somehow he doesn't seem to be the same gm. first
jeffries for jose, and now whiten for clark! if he
gets rid of brian jordan, then i'd have to believe that he
and whitey herzog switched bodies at the winter meetings!
cox: ok, keep trying on bream, and i'll wait til the trading
deadline for my hunter klesko platoon. maybe i can get a few
extra at-bats for cabrera while we wait. try california...
if snow starts slowly, maybe whiteydal will bite on sid.
and if that doesn't work, then perhaps sid's knees
could be ""persuaded"" to act up. there's always the
15-day dl! mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!
schuerholz: what about caraballo?
cox: well, he's not that much better than lemke. maybe if he starts
in richmond, he'll start walking more. besides, if he's going to be
arbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually
get some value from him before he makes the big bucks.
schuerholz: now, let's see. that leaves lopez.
cox: nooooo! i gotta keep lopez! sure, i didn't think olson
would recover this quickly. maybe i can talk caminiti into
running into him again?
schuerholz: nope, lopez has gotta go. you know that he'll get 3 million in arbitration. may as well put it off that one
extra year. besides, until olson's shown his stuff a little
bit, i can't trade him. besides, berryhill's a left-handed
hitter. you know how rare that is?
cox: don't you mean a left-handed whiffer? pretty common,
if you ask me. i mean, he made pat borders look good in
the world series. pat borders!!!
schuerholz: hey, you're the one who wouldn't write lopez
into the lineup.
cox: well, you're the one who went out and got me jeff
reardon! besides, i thought lopez wouldn't be used
to our pitching staff's stuff. he got some time with
them this spring...looked pretty good. come on, surely
we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?
schuerholz: yeah, but which stiff? whichever one we keep
will be hurt by may.
cox: ok, ok, you made your point. keep them both. surely
one of them will be on the dl by june at the latest. then i
can call up lopez, and then we can win 110 games! the pennant!
the world series! i'll be up there with john mcgraw! casey
stengel! earl weaver! oh, they laughed at me in toronto,
but have you ever had to deal with george bell? i'll finally
get my just reward! mwa-ha-ha-ha!
schuerholz: easy, bobby. have you been taking those
""happy pills"" left around by chuck tanner? why'd you
ever hire that guy anyhow?
cox: don't ask me; ask ted.

shortstop:
vizcaino vs weiss...vizcaino is excellent defensively, but is an
automatic out at bat. weiss isn't much better with the stick. even.

i watched him play at omaha the last couple years. until he actually proves

where florida might be even or better if the player there has a huge year.

scott pose vs wilson may...edge to may, even if wilson. hopefully the

a healthy harvey is a big edge to the marlins. meyers is decent, but
no harvey. of course, the cubs may have a few more games to save.

that it'll be one of the top 3 in the nl this year)

unfortunately, it shows that lopez wasn't as good an example as nieves would
have been, since his last year numbers were out of line with the previous
years (which i didn't have access to).
the point remains, though; knowing a guy's minor league history is as good
as knowing his major league history, if you know how to read it.
the mle is not a projection , it's an equivalence . it's a ""this is how
well he hit last year, in major league terms"" rating. so, in essence, he
has already reached it. i would guess (bob? clay?) that essentially half
of all players surpass their previous mles in their rookie seasons. maybe
more than half, since all of these players are young and improving.
did they? offerman may have been the difference between 4th or 5th place
and last place, but no more.
sure; they didn't have anyone better. i suppose they might have gutted the
farm system to acquire jay bell or spike owen or somebody if they were really
in contention.
if you'd read what i wrote, you'd be less amazed. nowhere do i claim to put
any credence in spring training. quite the contrary; i said that lopez hadn't
done anything that even the bozos who do put credence in spring training
could interpret as ""failure"". just because i think spring training numbers
are meaningless doesn't mean that bobby cox does; it's just a case of ruling
out one possible explanation for sending lopez down.

102713.eml,rec.sport.baseball,"mark, age doesn't matter; ability does. i would rather have the untried
rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven
himself to be average at best. i don't care if he is 15; if he plays
better than what i have, i want him out there. sandy alomar had decent
minor league numbers, grossly inflated by the pcl in general and las
vegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major
league hitter (which is good for a catcher, i'll admit). santiago's
numbers would probably come out the same as sandy's, but i don't have
the league data from the mid-80s to check it out.
that being said, i agree with sending lopez to richmond, at least to
start the season. as the box below shows, he has one minor league
season in which he hit well. he has two in which he hit very, very
poorly. i want to see that the 92 lopez is real. olson and berryhill
are not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially nl catchers,
they are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around
.220. if he had hit well at prior levels, i would say he belongs on
the braves; but there is a reasonable chance that lopez last year was
just as much a fluke as alomar in 90 or santiago in 87. one year at
any level, at any age, doesn't satisfy my standards of evidence.

on a similar note, i don't understand why more people are not
supportive of neon deion. granted, i thought his behavior with
mccarver last year was completely bush. last year was the first time
he ever got 300 ab in one place, so his lines are hard to read. but he
has a combined 720 ops in minor league play; with his speed is more
valuable than the ops alone indicates; and at a still young age (24),
had a monster year with an 868 ops. he has a total, major and minor,
eqa of .249; above major league average, and above average for cf
(which was about .240 in the nl last year). he has shown at least the
potential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15
best hitters in the league. he has two full seasons before reaching
his ""prime"" season of 27. he should be considered as a legitimate
prospect, and not as a simple side-show attraction.

on 6 11 90 he pitched his 6th no-hitter against oakland. i believe the
last out in the game was made by rickey henderson. and on 5 1 91, nolan
pitched his 7th no-hitter on the same day a certain someone stole his
939th base, which overshadowed it. it seems that nolan is having a lot of

102719.eml,rec.sport.baseball,"can anybody name a player who was 'rushed' to the majors (let's, for
argument's sake, define ""rushed"" as brought up to the majors for more than
a cup of coffee prior at age 22 or younger, and performing below
expectations), whose career was damaged by this rushing? i'm serious; i
tend to agree with david that bringing the player up sooner is better, but
i'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there are
any. i'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then i can
look up their minor league stats. (it's important to distinguish between
players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers
would have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but
actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).
let's kick it off with an example of a player who was ""rushed"", although
there doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career. jay bell was
given 135 pas in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what
you would expect from his aaa numbers the same season. he got 236 pas the
next year at age 22, and still underperformed. however, the next year, at
age 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job,
and has been there ever since. it's really hard for me to see where he
would have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was
performed quite well in aaa) during this time, rather than being ""rushed"";
cleveland might have been better off, i suppose, because they might have
been less likely to give up on him.
yes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle. but
does that delay the time at which he stops struggling, and starts
performing up to expectations?

102720.eml,rec.sport.baseball,"that's might be what it takes to beat the braves this year.

102721.eml,rec.sport.baseball,"i tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues.
the braves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they
had little talent on their roster for some time. steve avery, for example,
was rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign.
his subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5 era during his rookie
year. bill james pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so
and then rebound.
bob horner was also rushed to the majors (out of arizona state directly) had
good numbers immediately.
i am not certain of the ages of people like pete smith, craig mcmurty, and
derek lilliquist. the braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up
that they might have been rushed. lilliquist and smith struggled, but it
didn't hurt ps and dl may have been overhyped. i seem to recall cm pitching
well initially, though i don't have stats handy.

102724.eml,rec.sport.baseball,"this is the crux of the argument (to me at least). both the
sdcn and the non-sdcn camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher's
defense is basically nonmeasurable at present. you can talk about how
important calling a game is, or framing the pitches, or blocking balls
in the dirt. but there is little or no way to tell exactly how various
catcher's rank in ""defense"".
looking at lopez specifically; is there any reason to suspect
that he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the braves
(or the media) has labeled him a bad defensive catcher? as far as i
can tell he doesn't have any particular problem in his mechanics
(such as sasser). he might be a little rough around the edges in blocking
the ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to
clear that up is playing and practice time. i can't see how repetitions
at aaa are any better then reps in the majors!
all we're left with is the calling the game aspect. olsen and
berryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping
the pitchering staff. but this is a reputation that is given to almost
all veteran catchers. how is catching at aaa going to help lopez learn
the major league pitching staff? the only way any catcher is going to
learn tom glavine's pitches is to catch tom glavine. similarly, i wouldn't
be supprised if the pitcher's claimed to prefer pitching to olsen over
pitching to lopez because they are used to pitching to olsen. but
given time they will say they are comfortable with lopez.
now, since lopez can't learn how to handle the major league
pitcher's while he's in aaa and since he doesn't have any glaring
problem in his mechanics, what is he going to learn in aaa that he
can't learn just as well while in the majors?

the 1962 colt 45's finshed 8th - ahead of the cubs (the mets were last).
the 1969 royals finshed 4th - ahead of the white sox (the pilots in last).
the 1977 mariners finished 6th - ahead of the athletics(in last).
apparently being an expansion team with a poor a's or chicago
team around is a good thing'
this may be an appropriate comparison.
the 1929-31 yankees finshed 2nd, 3rd and 2nd finshing

1. baltimore orioles
why the orioles? well, i pondered long and hard, and it all came down to
this:
""but you don't really think the orioles will win, do you."" no. as a matter
of fact, i can't see any team in the american league winning either division
on paper (with the possible exception of the yankees, who i hate). but some-
body has to win, so i pick the orioles. ""you don't really think that brady
anderson is going to repeat, do you?"" no. i'm basing the orioles prediction
on the expectation of big years from cal ripken and glenn davis. ""glenn
davis? that's insane"". yes. so, without further ado:
strong points: hoiles, ripken some years, olson, getting rid of billy ripken.
weak points: segui may start. valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be
the fifth starter. oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.
(does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize
the effect of a slumping ripken? if you can't move ripken out of the 3
spot, why not move the rest of the line up?)
would be a good sign: glenn davis wins comeback player of the year.
would be a bad sign: in a tight pennant race, team trades for pecota.
obprediction: ""the streak"" continues. harold reynolds leads the team in
caught stealing.
2. new york yankees.
strong points: abbot, key, perez. could have best pitching in american
league. boggs should improve on hayes.
weak points: mattingly still considered best hitter. the steinbrenner
factor. (the yankees lost to the mets. can wholesale changes be far
behind?) never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. wickman millitello) to
win a division.
would be a good sign: boggs hits over .300
would be a bad sign: howe gets arrested again.
obprediction: mattingly won't top a 700 ops.
3. toronto blue jays
strong points: management willing to make big deals. management has eerie
power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects. olerud.
guzman. alomar.
weak points: the jackson for bell trade has shaken my faith in gillick.
losing stewart may hurt rotation (that's really a bad sign). no one in
the outfield can get on base. pitching is thin behind guzman and ward.
would be a good sign: jack morris considered cy young contender in august
would be a bad sign: club makes no major deals in august.
obprediction: morris will post better era and whip totals than last year. and
have a losing record.
4. milwaukee brewers
strong points: pitching staff was exceptional -- last year.
weak points: molitor gone. surhoff at third? why? eldred can't keep it up.
would be a good sign: listach and eldred play like last year.
would be bad sign: bones plays like last year.
obprediction: surhoff won't finish the year at third.
5. cleveland indians
strong points: baerga, belle, nagy
weak points: pitching staff thin -- losing olin really hurts. starts felix
fermin.
would be a good sign: bielecki's era is consistent with his atlanta starts.
would be a bad sign: ted power -- bullpen ace.
obprediction: alomar will be back on the dl by the all-star break.
6. boston red sox
strong points: clemens, viola, clemens, detroit, clemens
weak points: most incompetent gm in baseball. key free agent signing -- andre
dawson. burks is gone -- hatcher in center.
would be a good sign: rainouts in between clemens starts.
would be a bad sign: clemens on the dl
obprediction: russell will make sox fans forget reardon. interpret that how
you will :- 7. detroit tigers
strong points: tettleton, phillips, whitaker
weak points: if fielder keeps declining, he'll be a shortstop this year.
worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better.
this year could be very ugly.
would be a good sign: cecil fielder deserving the mvp.
would be a bad sign: cecil fielder not whining about deserving an mvp.

104320.eml,rec.sport.baseball,i don't.
104321.eml,rec.sport.baseball,"of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented.
just as a penny saved is a penny earned. enough with the cliches.
my point is that if the braves starters are able to live up to
their potential, they won't need much offensive support.
i realize this is a big if. this staff leaves the '92 bosox in the dust.
there is no legitimate comparison. two cy young winners, and three other
pitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first
or second starter. it seems to me that when quality pitchers take the
mound, the other teams score less runs. the team that scores the most
runs wins. this puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage
(providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs). a low
scoring game would clearly benefit the braves. they should have many
low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting.
on the flip side, if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players,
i would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers.
they would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their
opponent. the name of the games is to win. even ray knight knows that
you do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard.
all i'm trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers
like the braves have, the offense doesn't need to be as strong.

52550.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"funny you should mention it...this is exactly the case i was going to make.
i will grant that a star like mario will draw fans, even if the team sucks.
but this is short term only; i still do not think the attendance increase
will last, unless the team is a winning competitive improving butt-kicking
one. pittsburgh was still getting better, so people continued to support
them. if they suddenly dropped to, say, 50 points, you'd have knee surgery
for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon.
ok. my numbers came from the nhl guide and record book.
you can give the credit to mario since he deserves it. but my point is that
it wasn't mario himself, but it was the expectation of things to come (i.e.
a winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. and
before anybody jumps in and says i'm nit-picking and mincing words, go back
and read from where this thread started...
it might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind who suddenly
found an interest in mario and the pens. was it ""gee, mario lemieux is
amazing, i'll go watch him play"", or was it ""gee, now we've got a kick ass guy on our side, i'll go watch him play"". i think it was the latter.
i don't think this is accurate. the tickets sell, but people don't go to
the games. i think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket
holders in la don't always use their tickets. so in effect, after the kings
initial success following gretzky's arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)
and corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in
attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.
whether or not the kings are a 'winner' is debatable. i claim that since
gretzky's arrival they have at the very least been competitive...i also claim
that mcnall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the oiler
dynasty...but that's another story and included only because i don't like
mcnall:-). anyway, mcnall did do some heavy marketing around gretzky, and
that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising
sales, etc. but as i said, when the kings have been in there little
tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the
forum even if the tickets were sold.
for the short term, imo. although i think that it's inevitable that the team
will improve with a player such as lemieux or gretzky, simply because they
make people around them better.
well, at least we are in full agreement here!
so are you saying roger has ever had a valid point? yes, but they are doing no worse than last year. i think the same type of
reasoning i applied to a new pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people
showing up at winnipeg games. it's difficult to predict, but do you think
that if the jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they
will maintain their attendance levels? i seriously doubt it, because in that
case the expectation of an improving team would be gone, with or without
selanne.
i did provide the example of rocket ismail and the toronto argonauts of the
cfl...did you leave it out because you don't know much about the cfl? if
that's the case then fair enough, but if it isn't the case then i'm curious
to hear your explanation."
52551.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"implicitly you are assuming that goals scored against winnipeg with selanne
on the ice can be blamed on him...roger, he is a forward. winnipeg has a
lousy defensive record anyway. let's put it another way. john cullen's -
is terrible. what's your excuse for him? that his powerplay points don't
count? neither do selanne's...
knowledgeable hockey observers the world over would agree that
feeding selanne so he can score does contribute in a meaningful way to
winning.
you're worried about teemu when you have glenn anderson on your team?
what he does best is score...so i refer you to my comment above.
nope, didn't see it. i was too busy watching foligno jump up and down after his goal...."
52552.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"i can only comment on the kings, but the most obvious candidate for pleasant
surprise is alex zhitnik. he came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, but
he's clearly much more than that. great skater and hard shot (though wish he
were more accurate). in fact, he pretty much allowed the kings to trade away
that huge defensive liability paul coffey. kelly hrudey is only the biggest
disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. but, at best, he's
only a mediocre goaltender. a better choice would be tomas sandstrom, though
not through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in toronto decided
to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. other than that, the
award goes to robert lang, an uninspiring czech. robitaille could easily be
mvp, but i'd prefer to give it to rob blake who is quietly becoming one of the
league's premier defensemen, and if the kings manage to hold onto him and the
rest of our young defense, it could one day mean that we'll let in fewer
goals than hartford. honorable mentions to majestic marty and warren rychel.

still go out to see gretzky. this is the marketing strategy - selling the
game by selling the stars - that is employed by baseball and, notably, the
nba and this is the attitude that the new bettman mcnall leadership is
bringing to the league. they have gone on record as stating that they are
trying to sell the game on its stars. timo salami and brett hull are perfect
examples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet, being

off, after giving up the game. i find that easton blades are easier to get,

dried up bits of firewood, that some stores pass off as blades. in my

52574.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"well, since the oilers didn't win a heck of a lot of games, i'm not sure
they deserve and mvp (""can't win without him""). however, i'd suggest kelly
buchberger instead of dave manson, who has had a brutal year, his pick for
the all-star game notwithstanding.
as for biggest surprise, i'd say that buchberger had higher expectations
this year due to his ""breakthrough"" year (for him) last year, so he didn't
really raise his game. my suggestion would be shjon podein, one of the
callups from cape breton during the year. he was quite far down on the
depth chart in the oilers stable of prospects, but made a big impact on
the team. he has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only -1. those are decent
numbers for a third-line player who was seemingly doomed to minor-league
oblivion. the oilers coaching staff likens his style to john tonelli.
i think he'll be on the full-time roster next year.
as for biggest disappointment, you could name any of the players the oilers
dumped for lousy production this year (nicholls, gilchrist, tikkanen) or
even shayne corson, but mellanby isn't far off.

52575.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"actually, this part was really interesting. it turns out that the mask is
custom-fit to the goalie's face. the goalie puts his her face through a
piece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the face
and forehead to show. hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plastic
wrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face. then, a
plaster is spread on their cheeks, forehead, and chin which takes about 12
minutes to dry sufficiently. when it dries, it is effectively a mold of the
goalie's face. this is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves
padding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc.

52589.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"ten years ago, the number of europeans in the nhl was roughly a quarter
of what it is now. going into the 1992 93 season, the numbers of euros on
nhl teams have escalated to the following stats:
canadians: 400
americans: 100
europeans: 100
please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top
25 players on each of the 24 teams. my source is the vancouver sun.
here's the point: there are far too many europeans in the nhl. i am sick
of watching a game between an american and a canadian team (let's say, the
red wings and the canucks) and seeing names like ""bure"" ""konstantinov"" and
""borshevshky"". is this north america or isn't it? toronto, detriot, quebec,
and edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of euros on other
teams is getting worse as well.
i live in vancouver and if i hear one more word about ""pavel bure, the
russian rocket"" i will completely throw up. as it is now, every time i see
the canucks play i keep hoping someone will cross-check bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (by the way, i'm not a
canucks fan to begin with ;-).
okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. but the point is that
i resent nhl owners drafting all these europeans instead of canadians (and
some americans). it denies young canadians the opportunity to play in their
north american league and instead gives it to europeans, who aren't even
better hockey players. it's all hype. this ""european mystique"" is sickening,
but until nhl owners get over it, canadian and american players will continue
to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.
with the numbers of euros in the nhl escalating, the problem is clearly
only getting worse.
i'm all for the creation of a european hockey league, and let the bures
and selannes of the world play on their own continent.

jason bowen made a good play on his first nhl shift that almost created a goal.
he had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but instead
of taking the shot he found brind'amour crashing the net on the other side.
a perfect pass and a good shot across daren puppa's body should have been a
goal, but puppa made a great save reading the play.
garry galley gave the maple leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when
he hooked doug gilmour at 4:25. the flyers lowly 21st ranked penalty killing
unit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. the
maple leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense swept
away every rebound.
after the power play, the flyers got a goal on an ugly play. rod brind'amour
gave the puck to greg hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at the
net. puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of josef
beranek and bob rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. beranek was able to
get his stick on the puck and push it out to dineen who was skating into
the slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over puppa for
a 1-0 flyers lead at 8:10.
the flyers kept the pressure on, and puppa was the only leaf keeping the flyers
from building on their lead for a while. eventually things settled down and
defense prevailed. each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies
were strong. bowen started giving some lindros-like checks in his own corners.
then lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit foligno gave him, thought he had
a chance to even the score. he had foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into
him, and rode him into the center ice boards. the only problem was that foligno
was a little far from the boards, and mike ""mister"" mcgeough felt that it
warranted a boarding call at 15:38
the leafs couldn't get anything going on the power play as the flyers were
very aggressive (for a change) on the kill.
with time running out in the period, recchi carried through the neutral zone
and handed to lindros as they approached the leaf's blue line. they were in
a crowd with wendell clark and jamie macoun, lindros tried a backhand pass
to recchi through the feet of macoun that connected to recchi, but then clark
checked recchi off the puck. macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and
went right to mcgill who had manned the point. he drove it from just inside
the blue line. macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own
goalie at 19:55.1. shots were 13-8 flyers in the period.
the flyers finally got their first chance on the power play when dave andreychuk
tripped up rod brind'amour in his offensive zone. during the power play, the
flyers got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and eric
gloved it down, but mcgeough thought it hit his stick above his head. we
could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove
and the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. as time was
running out in the advantage, lindros found galley with a pass across the goal
mouth but puppa made the save. the rebound kicked back to the right corner where
recchi picked it up, passed it out to eric crashing through the right circle,
and eric one-timed past puppa at 7:55. with the assist, recchi moves past
bobby clarke's 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a flyer at
117. eric moves up to 4th all time in flyers rookie scoring with 67 points.
mike eastwood took down al conroy at 8:30 to give the flyers another chance on
the power play. not much pressure before garry galley ended the power play with
a slash at 9:19. not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the leafs had most
of the possession. the flyers smothered the leafs short power play. tempers
flared a little at 13:14. bowen and pearson got roughing minors, keith acton
got a bloody face. dave mcllwain then took a dive and got greg hawgood a
hooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. the replay showed that hawgood's
stick stopped making contact with mcllwain long before he spun around and fell.
again the flyers smothered the leafs power play, led by dimitri yushkevich.
bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on pearson. berehowski
tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. he had the puck at the point,
and just trickled a pass down the slot. he made all the flyers look silly as
nobody could get a stick on it, and it got to gilmour at the side of the net,
but soderstrom stoned him.
the flyers picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn't
get anything home. shots were 13-10 flyers.
the flyers were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they
decided that if tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a
little.
the flyers got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the
period, but couldn't get past puppa. then the leafs got tired of lindros making
road kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for doug gilmour and lindros
(unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for glenn anderson and mcgill (roughing)
all at 7:02. terry carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on gilmour.
again the flyers smothered the leafs power play.
at about the 12 minute mark, dave andreychuk got a shot away from his left
circle that got through soderstrom. the puck was rolling on it's side, and
as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards
it (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the
other). seconds later rod brind'amour tripped up gilmour at 12:24 to give the
leafs another chance on the power play. on the advantage, after soderstrom
stoned andreychuk while lying down, andreychuk got the rebound through
soderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept
away by one of his defensemen. they kept the pressure on, but soderstrom was
equal and preserved the shutout.
recchi cross checked ken baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl
at 16:01. no punches thrown, recchi got the initial minor, krushelnyski
baumgartner and lindros each got roughing minors. at 17:02 rouse and beranek
expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to
set up another 4 on 4. mike eastwood shoved down ryan mcgill in the flyers
zone as they were battling for the puck, and while mcgill was down he ran
his stick across mcgill's face. the flyers were not happy with that at all.
5-8 al conroy paired up with 6-1 berehowski, and started throwing punches.
upward. well, al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. each got
a couple punches in before going down in a head, and al got a standing o!
penalties: eastwood 5 (cross check) game, clark, carkner 10 each. berehowski
and conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49.
so a major penalty for the rest of the game for the flyers. the had no interest
in stting on the lead. hawgood, galley and brind'amour played catch until
hawgood found dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and
blasted it past puppa at 18:39.
that was all the fireworks, tommy soderstrom would not face another shot. puppa
did, but kept the flyers off the board. 4-0 flyers, shots were 9-8 flyers in the
3rd. probably the strongest game i've seen from the flyers since the all star
break. shutout number 4 for soderstrom, all since 1 10. tied for 2nd most in
the nhl, but he's played fewer games than belfour (6) or the goalie i can't
remember that he's tied with.
next up it's the winnipeg selannes tuesday night in winnipeg. the flyers cannot
be eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an islander win that night
in washington would be the official end.
flyers up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. last year they had 75 points
in 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6
games to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better
than 5 under in 80).
tragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. the tragic number for 5th
is 5 points, i watched the rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to
lose 5-4 before i finished this up. why 5 points instead of 4? well, the flyers
will win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the islanders win tie
breakers against the flyers and so need only a tie. the rangers could crumble
down the stretch as they play the devils, the pens twice, the flyers, and
finish up with 2 games against the caps. so i guess 5th place could be the
goal for the team to focus on.

anyways, crawl back into the hole you crawled out of...the nba doesn't

doesn't give a damn where they get baseball players from (except cuba,
that is).
canada is in no imminent danger of being overtaken as the primary
supplier of players...sweden, finland, the czech republic, and slovakia
are all relatively small countries, and cannot really produce players
at a greater rate than they are already producing them, and the
potential influx from the former soviet union is severely blunted
because the system has been raided and is starved for finances and
will take a decade or two, to recover and become a real threat, and
the us will just maintain its slow increase. canada should continue
to supply 60 plus of the top hockey players in the world for the
forseeable future.
besides we need the european hockey market if hockey is to take
its rightful place besides soccer as the two predominant world
sports...and since soccer is essentially boring, unlike hockey.
canadians are under no threat...the european numbers will soon saturate,
if they haven't already...and by the time russia comes online again,
the nhl should be a world league, and there will be many more teams
to stock and many more jobs for canadian hockey players. in the near
team, the percentage of canadians will mostly decline because of
americans, not because of europeans.
crawl into a hole and die...

north american heritage back a lot further than most of us.

i've seen players with questionable tactics, but never have i seen
what ray did on sunday. this guy gets my all time loser award. it's
one thing to repeatedly cross check someone to the back of the neck
when they are down, it's another thing to have a fist fight with
someones balls. ray should be thrown out of the league, what an
a hole.

there are also some rumours about erik kakko (reipas) and marko jantunen

finnish olympic team. i think that jantunen is drafted to the nhl, too.

he has reached the top level among finnish centres. he had very good

would surprise me anymore. i lied. how the hell can a team go into
washington, earn a shutout, then come back home and lose to pitiful
hartford? the absolute pinnacle of mediocrity. i can't stand it.
from what i've read, the goalie is to blame this time, as beezer played
pretty poorly. smith is talking about calling up corey hirsch from
binghamton, everybody is pointing fingers... this is definitely not the
same team which wanted to prove itself in washington. now nothing that
happens in the patrick will surprise me. (yeah, right... ;-)

52638.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"i've never seen a game where one player has committed 5
penalties. something like this would require more attention by
the referee.
but you're creating a scoring opportunity where there might not
have been one before. i can see the relationship between free
throws awarded after a certain number of fouls, but it's
obviously easier to score in basketball, there are more
opportunities. if a basketball team scores 100 points, that's
at least fifty chances made. the average number of shots taken
by each team in a hockey game (and this is a total guess) is
probably around 40, and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe
5 of them. you have some good ideas concerning the other
penalties, but i think that a player should be awarded a
penalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was
interfered with.
also, later in the post, you talked about how boring the nba
game you attended was, that play was stopped too often.
wouldn't your penalty shot rule take up more time during a
hockey game?

get muckler as coach, and kovalev will look like mogilny.
the trouble with the rangers is that neil smith went out and got
players like messier, kovalev, and graves who have been schooled in
taking the game to their opponent and attacking, while hiring coaches
who are interested in ""rope-a-dope"" strategies. if you want the

much too complicated. how will the normal average fan be able to count
how many fouls a player has? and then we would even have to remember the
names of the players, in order to determine who drew the foul! and, of
course, there will have to be new ""sub-positions"", like the power center
who just sits in the slot until the (blue, of course) puck comes near him,
and the ""shooting defenseman"" and the ""point defenseman"". finally, we'll
be able to keep stats on the best and the worst penalty-shot takers.
since almost everyone on the ice will be getting fouled, we'll be able to
see ulf samuellson (sp?) and tie domi miss penalty shots like crazy.

his relief effort for beaupre, he has looked mighty sharp - don't
forget the shutout. i think he's let in just four goals over eight
periods of play. i like hrivnak, but we might actually have to give
some credit to david poile for a change after this trade.
hopefully if tabaracci starts against the isles tonight, i haven't
jinxed him.
frank salvatore"
52651.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"my votes (fwiw):
team mvp: pat verbeek. he fans on 25 of goal mouth feeds, but he still has
36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain
throughout a tough couple of seasons. honorable mention: nick kypreos and
mark janssens. probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than
mvp, but kypreos (17 goals, 320 pim) has been the hardest working player on
the team and janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. i guess
i place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.
biggest surprise: geoff sanderson. he had 13 goals and 31 points last season
as a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80 points. he now has a new whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming
from the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. honorable mention: andrew
cassels and terry yake. the kiddie quartet of sanderson, poulin, nylander, and
petrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but cassels is just 23
and will score close to 90 points this season. he has quite nicely assumed the
role of number one center on the team and works very well with sanderson. yake
bounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put
up about 20 goals and 50 points this season. yake, like sanderson, started
performing better offensively once he was converted from center to wing,
although lefty sanderson went to the left wing and righty yake went to the
right side.
biggest disappointment: hands down, john cullen. cullen had a disasterous 77
point season last year, his first full season after the trade. cullen started
the season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate,
since he spent all of his whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it).
cullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded
the powerplay to a 9 success percentage ( 21 with sanderson), and sulked his
way out of town. worst of all, his 4 year, 4m contract had three years left
to run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the
maple leafs offered to hartford. honorable mention: steve konroyd, also subpar
after signing a 3 year, 2.1m contract; eric weinrich, who showed flashes of
competence, but overall has played poorly; jim mckenzie, who was a much better
hockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and frank pietrangelo, who only
seemed to play well when sean burke was out for an extended period and he got
to make a number of starts in a row.

52656.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"gee, you'd think winnipeg would be tops on that list, what with 8 regulars
being european.
well, being a jet fan, i sometimes wish that bure would get knocked silly
too. (nothing serious, just enough to keep him out of a game. :)
in most cases, the owners have very little to do with it. they give their
general managers one order when it comes to the draft...find me the best
players so that our team will win the stanley cup. whether that player is
in kindersley, saskatchewan or chelyabinsk, russia, if the gm believes him
to be the better player, the gm should be drafting him.
where do you get off calling the nhl their league, when referring to canadian
players. it doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the owners. the owners
can do what they want. while a 'canadian content' rule might be enforcable
here in canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the us
that the cfl (sorry for the football reference) didn't even try to push their
import ratio rule on the sacromento goldminers.
increasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, would
make players better anyways. (oh yeah, and how many europeans play at the
lower levels of professional hockey in north america? while there are some
that play in the ahl, or the ihl where that's an nhl team's primary farm
club, you don't hear of many europeans playing in the chl, the echl, or on
the secondary farm teams in the ihl. (ie. the jets do have a few russian
players in moncton, but i don't believe there are any europeans in ft. wayne.))
so with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey players
in north america.
i'm in favour of the nhl being the league for the premier players in the
world. i've grown up with europeans playing on 'my' team, and some of those
players were the among the best in the world. from hedberg, nilsson, and
sjoberg, to sel nne, zhamnov, and olausson, and all those in between and to
come, i wouldn't have it any other way.

52661.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"this brings up a question i asked myself (no answer) when it was mentionned
that the nhl could expand in europe.
would most of the north-americans now playing in the nhl be willing
to play for a team in europe?
i do not think that the majority of hockey players are necessarily
interested in expanding their cultural experience to that level.
(i know i would but i am not a pro hockey player)
when one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes
me wonder how a european expansion could be achieved. remember these:
- lindros did not want to play in quebec (for more than reasons)
- nicholls ... in edmonton.
- r. courtnall wanted to be traded to la only.
- c. lemieux said he would refuse to go to edmonton earlier this year.
i know there are many non-cultural reasons behind these but there is more:
- some american players who played for the expos complained about the french
fact and that the city was not quite like the other us cities. one
players' wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could
not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in montreal.
anybody knows what happened when all these us football players moved
to london, spain, etc .. for the one year of that new football league
(2 years ago?)
i wonder what the players association thinks about going to europe.
myself i would like to see some european teams, but what would be
the best way to do it?

52662.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"no no no! since all the penalties fall into three classes, there should
only be three penalties:
1. foul (any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your
body or stick). if you get 5 you are out for the game.
2. unsportsmanlike contact. (an intentional foul). this inlcludes all the
current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. if you get two you
are thrown out of the game, and fined.
3. technical foul. bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. penalty shot
is awarded. two and you are thrown out of the game.
besides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penalties
in a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one,
until the end of the period. the victim gets two shots if he she was in
the act of shooting when the foul ocured.
this works well for several reasons. first, penalty shots are the most
exciting thing in hockey, right? so, it follows that the more the better.
next, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network can
take a commercial. finally, with only three penalties, the network
announcers (don meredith, dick vitale, john madden, pat summerall, and
marv levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before
the pa announcer says it.
oh, one other rule. when a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the play
cannot resume until the pa announcer announces it. this way, the network
can sneak in a few more commercials. then, once the pa announcer has told
them who scored, the tv announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a
chance of pronouncing his name right.
seriously, though, i actually went to see a nba basketball game last week,
for the first time in my life. i was amazed how boring it was. the play is
so slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting
contests during the period!. of course the 'laker girls' get to do their
routines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periods
either. there is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. the
game is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a
10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.
the reason for this has to be tv. there is plenty of room to throw in
commercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening.
on tv, basketball is fairly entertaining, imho. but, it is better to watch
it on tv than to be there. if this is the road the nhl is following, then
it truly is a sad day.
enough for now.

teams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in

8. answers to some frequently asked questions:
q: why are the montreal canadiens called the habs?
a: most of the team during the 40-50's was made up of people who lived in
and around montreal. hence they were called ""les habitants"" (natives of
montreal). this was then shortened to the habs.
q: why is the montreal canadiens logo a large c with an h within it?
a: in 1914-15, the canadiens logo consisted of c with an a within it to
signify club athletique canadien (cac). the next year, cac no longer
existed and it was changed to what it is now to signify club de hockey.
q: what is the most informative hockey publication?
a: the hockey news is preferred by most north american hockey fans. it is
a weekly journal with up-to-date info.
phone: 800-268-7793 (canada and us)
phone fax: 0483 776141 (uk and rest of europe)
q: how does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in
the nhl?
a: if x goals are scored, then the team gets credit for x goals in x 1
chances.
q: how is - computed in the nhl?
a: first, - only applies to skaters. except for a power-play goal, when
a goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a , and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. short-
handed goals do count for -.
q: what is the five-hole?
a: the space between a goalie's pads. there are five major scoring zones:
(1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower
right, and (5) five-hole.
q: what is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?
a: this tradition began in detroit in the 1950's when two best-of-seven
series were required to win the stanley cup. every time detroit won a
game, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.
q: who was the first woman to play in an nhl game?
a: manon rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever
to play in an nhl game on september 23, 1992 when she started in net for
the expansion tampa bay lightning in an exhibition against the st. louis
blues. rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat
expo hall on the florida state fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine
shots. she left with the score tied 2-2, although the lightning ultimately
lost the game, 6-4.
q: what is the richest contract in nhl history?
a: mario lemieux, the superstar center of the pittsburgh penguins, signed
the richest contract in nhl history, a seven-year deal believed to be
worth about 42 million. lemieux will earn between 6 million and 7
million a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.
q: who is the new commissioner of the nhl?

53521.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"how about that tocchet head-butt? is there an automatic susppension that
goes along with a (non-kicking) match penalty? i can't remember anymore.
oh, the playoffs should be fun,
ralph"
53522.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"yeah, and also be second in the team in scoring and play about 35
minutes a game and play on the power play and kill penalties and be the
best defenseman in the league. i'd take a whole team of chelioses if i
could. (that way, when one got a penalty the others could kill it!)
ralph"
53523.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"well matt, mattias timmander hasn't been playing with the modo elite league
team yet (just the modo junior team), so i predict he needs a few more years
here before he can join the b's. i saw him play in the swedish championship
game for junior players this year, and he played very well, a physical game,
but not the kind of rough stuff that ulfie does (i suspect you would like to
have a ulf type-of-player on the b's team too? :)
as for mariusz czerkawski, he has had a great season for hammarby in
division 1. he scored -if i remember correctly- 93 points this season,
and then we have to keep in mind that a 50 point season in sweden is
considered very good due to the limited number of games. mariusz is
djurgarden property (he was just on loan to hammarby), so he will play
in elitserien next season, unless the b's can get him of course.
i would say that mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to
watch in swedish hockey this season.

53524.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"however, i have some more comments on the islanders and hockey in
general that i need to get off my chest :). first of all, with the islanders
back-to-back lackluster performances against the whalers, one may think that
the islanders are out of shape. these guys always suck wind in the 2nd period,
come on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon. it is unbelieveable
how many one goal games these guys have lost. anyway, the games was pretty
wide open. the isles still have tons of trouble scoring. the whalers played
a golie in is 1st nhl start, i think his name was lenarduzzi (sp?). (his nhl
debut was the tuesday tie against the isles). like i mentioned before, this
guy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a
mahlakov slap shot to go to ot). i say it's because the isles don't shoot
correctly. has anyone else noticed this?
also, i think it is really a shame for hockey when i guy like mick
vukota gets as much ice time as he does. this guy has about as much hockey
talent as jiggs macdonald (who did play hockey, i think). anytime he gets the
puck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties.
richard pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap. and he's a
defenseman. he's got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus minus.
this guy gets beaten all the time. why the need for such ""enforcers""? not
only do fights slow the game down alot, but it takes away from the guys who are
really trying to play the game. i'll be one of the few to admit, i do enjoy a
good fight once in a while, but only when it's ""called for"". you know, when a
guy checks the goalie too hard. in other words, a violation of ""hockey ethics""
might cause you to get puched. but there is no need to start crap when you are
losing or becuase you can get away with it!! does anyone agree that referees
need to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and ot? i mean come on already.
i'm sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the
referee doesn't call it. ot and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy,
not physical prowess. trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost.
if you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to
pull a guy down to prevent it, you don't deserve to win in the first place.
just my honest opinion,
gary at hofstra"
53525.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"markus had a good season in modo in the swedish elite league, scoring
22 goals, 17 assists, 39 points and 67 pim in 39 games.
as daryl points out, markus won't be joining the pens for this year's
playoffs, since the world championships starts april 18th.
but there is a good chance that markus will join the pens before next
season. modo, though, naturally wants to keep their superstars forsberg
and naslund, so the latest news on this is that modo is looking for
personal sponsors for forsberg and naslund in order to match the kind
of money they would receive in nhl.
actually, swedish coach curt lundmark is thinking about leaving two
spots open for additions from eliminated nhlers. it is mats sundin and
calle johansson that curt hopes can join the team, although in a late
stage of the tournament. technically, i seem to recall that you can leave
spots open until 24 hrs before the wc final.

53528.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"this was for anybody who
would like to check.
he went on (in another article) to say paraphrased so, roger, what exactly is playoff hockey all about? or is it a convenient
phrase to use in certain circumstances only?
you see, when you spout off with flame bait too many times, sooner or later
it catches up with you...."
53529.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"actually this stuff from mogilny doesn't surprise me all that much. about 4
or 5 weeks ago i read in the toronto sun a quote from alex; it went something
like sarcastically :
""yep, patty's the man. he's responsible for the team's success...i'm a
nobody around here.""
i was going to post it at the time...i must have forgot since nobody else
was talking about him being a problem.
yep, i'd beat the shit out of him too. lafontaine really must be a team
player...makes you wonder what the islander management was thinking.
my question is what the hell is muckler doing? whether he wishes to admit it
or not, the team is his to coach, and if he can't do the job then maybe the
job should be given to somebody who can.
gee, kinda like alex's spot on the team, isn't it?"
53530.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"well, it seems that the habs have been much talked-about of late, so here's my 0.02. these guys have absolutely no concept of how to play in front of the
damn net!!! watch them in the offensive zone, especially on the powerplay.
damphousse or lebeau will skate all over the bloody zone, maybe pass to the
point, get it back, skate some more, pass it around....but where's the shot??!
answer: the shot is totally useless because they lack a forward who stands
in front of the net a la neely, shanahan, tocchet, etc etc. too bad
demers won't put dipietro or leclair on the powerplay more often. dammit,
even ewen would at least cause some disruptions. montreal desperately needs
a power forward with some talent, imo.
then watch them in their own zone. patrick roy is screened on everything. say
what you want about his performance; imnsho he cannot stop what he cannot see.
and montreal's defence does a miserable job of clearing the front of the net.
last night against washington roy played a great game. the first goal came
on the most ridiculous goalmouth scramble i've seen in a long time, and he
didn't have a hope in hell of stopping the shot. the second goal came on a
deflection of a shot he only partially saw anyway. pathetic defence. the
third goal was en.
no wonder he gets pissed off at his defencemen."
53531.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"wales conference, adams division, semifinal
i'm hoping for a fuhr miracle, but i agree that boston will likely win the
series. goaltending is about equal, top offensive players are about equal
(mogilny-lafontaine vs. oates-juneau), but buffalo has no answer to neely
(not to imply that neely is not a top offensive player btw, in fact he's one
of my favourites even though he's a damn bruin :) ). and the rest of the
matchup wrt lineup favours boston anyway. but i think it will go six.
agreed here...but montreal will be pushed to the limit. is it just me, or
does everything montreal does in the playoffs come down to roy? go habs!!
final
i can't predict a montreal victory because i've been watching them play for
6 weeks and imo they severly need some tougher players, especially to play
in the garden. last time they beat the b's 5-2 but boston had a clear
territorial advantage; the victory was roy's. at the same time, i can't
bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss, so i'll just say i will
not be putting money on this series. :-)
agreed. ny doesn't have the goaltending to stop the onslaught, independent
of the trouble they have given pittsburgh this year. pens in five, which is
credit to ny.
agreed here too, but i think it will go at least six. jersey has a decent
team, and washington has done poorly against the division this year.
i think they will use tabaracci more after beaupre gets shelled. i don't
think it will go six either... maybe five.
if pittsburgh plays boston, imo they win in likely five, possibly six. they
own the bruins. if they play montreal, i think it will go to seven, and once
again i won't be putting money on the seventh game. i say seven because the
habs have played pittsburgh very tough this season.
chicago will win, but i think in at least six. chicago is not that good,
imo. and remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties.
very true. the leafs have much to be proud of, but they will soon find out
why montreal did so lousy in the playoffs. toronto might win two or three
at mlg though. wings in six, maybe even seven.
it will be a war...possibly the most intense playoff series of them all.
and yes, i think detroit will win. probert will have to come up big though.
our first disagreement. canucks are playing like shit. they don't use their
size at all , which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a team
chasing them (calgary)....winnipeg in six.
this is also tough for me to call, because i haven't seen the smythe enough.
i don't think roberts will be well enough to figure in, coffey is a
non-issue, who cares what carson has done before, and never underestimate
gretzky. la in six.
if it is these two, calgary will not need six games. but i think it will be
la-winnipeg anyway, and la in seven, because of home ice.
wow, must've been tough to go against your team. but let's see, i picked
la-detroit. detroit will win, probably in six.
if pittsburgh plays detroit, it will go longer than five, and i wouldn't bet
against the wings. they are very strong, imo, and nobody knows how strong
because they've been underachieving most of the year. if forced to choose,
though, i'd have to take the penguins.
a side note. vlad, last week you said that selanne was a better player than
gilmour. no way. he is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside from
the age difference, there is no way i would take him over gilmour on my team.
i'm not asking for flames, either, btw....i've spent more than enough time
arguing on behalf of selanne and i still say he's a great player. but while
he and gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give teemu an edge),
gilmour does it all . i know a lot of gilmour-bashing goes on, esp.
from flame fans. but imo you guys are letting your dislike of gilmour cloud
your judgement when it comes to his skill. he is easily one of the best
all-round players in the nhl."

53534.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"there is really nothing inherently wrong with it but they tried it just
a little over a decade ago, and noone showed up for the early rounds in
the playoffs...whereas soon after they went to the divisional set-up
arenas were mostly filled in the early rounds.
the empirical evidence of the last two decades is that more people will
show up to see the bruins play the sabre umpteen times than see the
bruins play the captials in the first round.
maybe hockey has increased in popularity sufficiently that this will
no longer be the case. the experiment is worthwhile with the uneven
distribution of the expansion teams, but i prefer the divisional
playoff.

53535.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"pocklington just wanted to wake up the powers that be holding political

with their current lease arrangement are in a state where on a yearly
basis they will likely have an operating loss based on ""normal"" hockey
revenues and expenses. that he did this was a good thing...it is better
he complain early, and make the city aware of a potential looming crisis
before he begins to lose millions and millions of dollars...which would
truly jeopardize the franchise.
pocklington's first option is not to sell or to move, but to sell
a minority share of the team (to realize some of the appreciated value
of the team) and to get a better arena deal, either in northlands, or
via a new building. pocklington probably isn't going to get exactly
what he wants...but ultimately he will probably get enough, or will
sell to someone who will probably get enough.

53548.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"how can you assume it was a sarcastic remark?
for someone whose first language is not english, i would interpret
that comment to mean that he believes pat is the mvp on the team and that
he is just one of the other normal players. quite modest i might say."
53549.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"nice try deepak, but ""tough whaler squad"" should have clued you in to the
fact that my leaf woofing was tongue-in-cheek.
if playoff hockey is any more intense than the regular season variety then
it is because the teams are facing each other at least 4 consecutive times
in 7 days and hockey being the contact sport that it is, some things will
be carried over that might dissipate during the regular season. but that is
only for some of the players. many of the rest, who have been playing with
injuries, who miss their families, or who, like grant fuhr, would really
rather be playing golf, don't really give a damn. of course i can't say this
for sure, but i believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and i
don't think that hockey players are above having what i consider typically
human attitudes.
with the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing
money by participating in the playoffs. the ones who regard the playoff
""take"" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely
to consistently be a force in the playoffs. now i know some of you are
going to come back with ""winning spirit"" and all of that crap but these
players are professionals after all. while they may love to play the
game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make
a decent living.
of course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is
being paid to do is motivate the players. so, if the coach does his
job well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.
the second season, is after all, merely an exhibition. the true champions
of the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top
after the long struggle of the season. the stanley cup playoffs merely
accord victory to the team that has remained healthy and ""hot"". the
emphasis on the playoffs, with their ""sudden death"" appeal has been promoted
by the media and the owners with profit purely in mind. even if pittsburgh
loses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the
league over the year. they proved it.

14147.eml,sci.crypt,"about this posting
this is a (still rather rough) listing of likely questions and
information about ripem, a program for public key mail encryption. it
(this faq, not ripem) was written and will be maintained by marc
vanheyningen, it will be posted to a
variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific
to ripem is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.
this month, i have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply
with the standards for hypertext faq formatting to allow easy
manipulation of this document over the world wide web. let me know
what you think.
disclaimer
nothing in this faq should be considered legal advice, or anything
other than one person's opinion. if you want real legal advice, talk
to a real lawyer.
questions and answers
1) what is ripem?
ripem is a program which performs privacy enhanced mail (pem) using
the cryptographic techniques of rsa and des. it allows your
electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who
sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except
the intended recipient.)
ripem was written primarily by mark riordan most of the code is in the public domain, except for the rsa routines,
which are a library called rsaref licensed from rsa data security inc.
2) how can i get ripem?
ripem contains the library of cryptographic routines rsaref, which is
considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution
to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the u.s. or
canada. therefore, the following request is quoted from the readme
file: please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution outside of the usa or canada. this is a personal request from me, the author of ripem, and a condition of your use of ripem.
note that rsaref is not in the public domain, and a license for it is
included with the distribution. you should read it before using
ripem.
the best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will
reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the
humans that run them.) naturally this requires that you trust the
friend.
ripem is available via anonymous ftp to citizens and permanent residents
in the u.s. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref and read the readme file for
info. last i looked, this site contains only the source tree, and
does not contain compiled binaries or the nice mac version.
ripem, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its ""home site"" on
rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous ftp for users in the
u.s. and canada who are citizens or permanent residents. to find out
how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub crypt , and read the file
getting access. for convenience, binaries for many architectures are
available here in addition to the full source tree.
3) will ripem run on my machine?
probably. it has already been ported to ms-dos and most flavors of
unix (sunos, next, linux, aix, ultrix, solaris, etc.) ports to
macintosh include a standard unix-style port and a rather nice
mac-like port written by raymond lau, author of stuffit. more ports
are expected, and help of users is invited.
4) will ripem work with my mailer?
probably. how easy and clean the effective interface is will depend
on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though. the users
guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use ripem
with many popular mailers, including berkeley, mush, elm, and mh.
code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of ripem inside gnu
emacs.
if you make a new interface for ripem or create an improvement on one
in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,
and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.
5) what is rsa?
rsa is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key. this means
that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to
decrypt. because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,
you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your
decryption, or private key to yourself. anyone can use your public
key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to
decrypt it. (note that the ""message"" sent with rsa is normally just
the des key to the real message. (see ""what is des?"")
note that the above only provides for privacy. for authentication,
the fingerprint of the message (see ""what is a fingerprint, like
md5?"") is encrypted with the sender's private key. the recipient can
use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message
must have come from the sender.
rsa was named for the three men (rivest, shamir and adleman) who
invented it. to find out more about rsa, ftp to rsa.com and look in
pub faq or look in sci.crypt.
6) what is des?
des is the data encryption standard, a widely used symmetric, or
secret-key, crypto system. unlike rsa, des uses the same key to
encrypt and decrypt messages. however, des is much faster than rsa.
ripem uses both des and rsa; it generates a random key and encrypts
your mail with des using that key. it then encrypts that key with the
recipient's public rsa key and includes the result in the letter,
allowing the recipient to recover the des key.
des is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a
key length considered too short by modern standards. however, it
should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large
corporation or government agency. it is not unlikely that future
ripems will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using
multiple encryption with des.
7) what is pem, and how does ripem relate?
pem is privacy enhanced mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of
encrypted electronic mail. it is described in rfcs 1421-1424; these
documents have been approved and obsolete the old rfcs 1113-1115.
ripem is not really a complete implementation of pem, because pem
specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which ripem does not
handle at this time. their addition is planned.
8) what's this about distributing and authenticating keys?
for a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know
your public key. for you to be able to confirm that the message
received came from her, you must know her public key. it is important
that this information be accurate; if a ""bad guy"" convinces her that
his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.
ripem allows for three methods of key management: a central server,
the distributed finger servers, and a flat file. all three are
described in the ripem users guide which is part of the distribution.
none of them provide perfect security.
9) why do all ripem public keys look very similar?
ripem public keys begin with a pkcs identifier describing various
characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in
your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys.
this does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the
same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the
same length, etc.
10) what is a fingerprint, like md5?
md5 is a message digest algorithm produced by rsa data security inc.
it provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,
of the plaintext. it is cryptographically secure because it is not
possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a
different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint. thus,
instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,
only the md5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.
md5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often
used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a
passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.
md5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in c) in
rfc 1321.
11) what is pgp?
pgp is another cryptographic mail program called pretty good privacy.
pgp has been around longer than ripem, and works somewhat differently.
pgp is not compatible with ripem in any way, though pgp does also use rsa.
some major differences between pgp and ripem:
- pgp has more key management features, particularly for users without
a direct network connection.
- ripem conforms to the pem rfcs and thus has a greater probability of
working with other pem software. pgp makes no attempt to be compatible
with anything other than pgp (in fact, pgp 1.0 is not compatible with
pgp 2.0.)
- ripem uses rsaref, a library of rsa routines from rsa data security
inc. rsaref comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.
pgp uses its own implementation of rsa which is not licensed; thus,
pkp, the firm holding the u.s. patents on the rsa algorithm, claims
that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell pgp in
the u.s. or canada. in acknowledgement of this, pgp's original
author, phil zimmermann, says in the documentation: in fact, if you live in the usa, and you are not a federal agency, you shouldn't actually run pgp on your computer, because public key partners wants to forbid you from running my software. pgp is contraband.
- both pgp and ripem are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside
the u.s. and canada. however, pgp already exists on many ftp sites
in europe and other places.
whether you use pgp or ripem or whatever, the documentation to pgp is
recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.
note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export
restrictions, are somewhat controversial; many people think it
shouldn't be that way, and some people interpret various documents
differently. unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably
seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in
misc.legal.computing. (see: ""disclaimer"")
12) what about rpem?
rpem stands for rabin privacy enhanced mail. it was similar to ripem,
but used a public-key cipher invented by rabin (which is not rsa) in
an attempt to avoid the patent on rsa. it was written by mark
riordan, the same author as ripem.
its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many
(including rabin), public key partners (pkp) claimed that their patent
was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested
in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes, not just rsa.
this claim is not universally accepted by any means, but was not
challenged for pragmatic reasons.
rpem is not really used anymore. it is not compatible with ripem or pgp.
13) what is mime?
mime stands for multipurpose internet mail extensions, and is
described in rfc 1341. you can find out about it in the newsgroup
comp.mail.mime. how pem should interact with mime is not yet entirely
clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a mime type
application x-ripem in order to send ripem messages as mime ones. i
hope some standards will emerge. draft internet documents exist on
the matter.
14) i have this simple way to defeat the security of ripem...
you may wish to check the companion post ""ripem-attacks"" which
discusses some of the more obvious attacks on ripem's security and
what procedures will minimize the risk. ripem's main ""weak area"" is
probably key distribution."

questions and answers
1) what is ripem?
ripem is a (not yet complete, but useful) implementation of privacy
enhanced mail (pem). ripem allows your electronic mail to have the
four security facilities provided by pem: disclosure protection
(optional), originator authenticity, message integrity measures, and
non-repudiation of origin (always). (see: ""what is pem?"")
ripem was written primarily by mark riordan most of the code is in the public domain, except for the rsa routines,
which are a library called rsaref licensed from rsa data security inc.
the current version of ripem is 1.0.5; the current version of the
macintosh port of ripem is 0.7.
2) how can i get ripem?
ripem uses the library of cryptographic routines rsaref, which is
considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution
to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the u.s or
canada without an export license. no such license has been obtained
(nor would one likely be granted unless the rsa key exchange were
shortened to 512 bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something
weaker than des. there are some suggestions that this situation may
change now that clinton is in office.) the author requests in the
readme file that this law not be violated: please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution outside of the usa or canada. this is a personal request from me, the author of ripem, and a condition of your use of ripem.
note that rsaref is not in the public domain, and a license for it is
included with the distribution. you should read it before using
ripem.
ripem is available via anonymous ftp to citizens and permanent
residents in the u.s. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref and read the readme
file for info. note that the non-rsaref portion of ripem is not a
product of rsa data security, incorporated; they merely are helping
distribute it.
ripem, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its ""home site"" on
ripem.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous ftp for users in the
u.s. and canada who are citizens or permanent residents. to find out
how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub crypt , and read the file
getting access. for convenience, binaries for many architectures are

probably. how easy and clean the effective interface is will depend
on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though. the users
guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use ripem
with many popular mailers, including berkeley, mush, elm, and mh.
code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of ripem inside gnu
emacs.
if you make a new interface for ripem or create an improvement on one
in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,
and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.
5) what is rsa?
rsa is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key. this means
that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to
decrypt. because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,
you may publish your encryption, or public, key widely and keep your
decryption, or private, key to yourself. anyone can use your public
key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to
decrypt it. note that the ""message"" sent with rsa is normally just
the des key to the real plaintext. (see ""what is des?"")
note that the above only provides for disclosure protection. for
originator authenticity, message integrity, and non-repudiation of
origin services to be implemented, the fingerprint of the message
(see ""what is a fingerprint, like md5?"") is encrypted with the
sender's private key. the recipient, or a dispute-resolving
authority, can use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm
that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered.
rsa was named for the three men (rivest, shamir and adleman) who
invented it. to find out lots more about rsa and modern cryptography
in general, ftp to rsa.com and look in pub faq . some information
also may be in sci.crypt.
6) what is des?
des is the data encryption standard, a widely used symmetric, or
secret-key, crypto system. unlike rsa, des uses the same key to
encrypt and decrypt messages. however, des is much faster than rsa.
ripem uses both des and rsa; it generates a random key and encrypts
your mail with des using that key. it then encrypts that key with the
recipient's public rsa key and includes the result in the letter,
allowing the recipient to recover the des key.
des is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a
key length considered too short by modern standards. however, it
should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large
corporation or government agency. it is not likely that the pem
standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the
near future, because there is a strong feeling that pem should be
stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with
interoperability.
7) what is a fingerprint, like md5?
md5 is a message digest algorithm produced by rsa data security inc.
it provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,
of the plaintext. it is cryptographically secure because it is not
possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a
different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint. thus,
instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,
only the md5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.
md5s can also be exchanged directly for authentication; for example,
ripem public keys include an md5 of the public key in the file, so
parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate
channel merely need exchange md5s of keys and verify their accuracy.
md5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often
used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a
passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.
md5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in c) in
rfc 1321.
there have been some recent suggestions that md5 may not be as strong
a hash as was originally believed; presumably some other hash
function will be used if this is accepted as true.
8) what is pem?
pem is privacy enhanced mail, a standard for allowing transfer of
encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a
working group of experts. it is described in rfcs 1421-1424; these
documents have been approved and obsolete the old rfcs 1113-1115.
ripem is not really a complete implementation of pem, because pem
specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which ripem does not
handle at this time. their addition is planned.
9) what's this about distributing and authenticating keys?
for a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know
your public key. for you to be able to confirm that the message
received came from her, you must know her public key. it is important
that this information be accurate; if a ""bad guy"" convinces her that
his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.
ripem allows for three methods of key management: a central server,
the distributed finger servers, and a flat file. all three are
described in the ripem users guide which is part of the distribution.
none of them provide perfect security. the pem standard calls for
key management by certificates; the addition of this feature to ripem
is planned, but chicken-egg issues still exist.
10) isn't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like pem?
this issue has been considered in the standards process. rfc 1310,
the specification for internet standards, has a discussion (section
6) on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be
met for a patented method to be included in a standard. rfc 1421
addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public-key
cryptography.
this does not, of course, mean that all questions are settled or that
everyone is in agreement. an interesting exchange on the use of
patented algorithms in standards with regard to public-key
cryptography is in the league for programming freedom archive
(available via ftp: ftp.uu.net: doc lpf) in the files bidzos.letter
and bidzos.response. (amusingly, the lpf files on ftp.uu.net are
compressed with a patented algorithm.)
11) what about rsadsi pkp?
rsa data security, inc. (rsadsi) is a california-based company
specializing in cryptographic technologies. public key partners is a
firm which holds exclusive sub-licensing rights of the following u.s.
patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents:
cryptographic apparatus and method
(""diffie-hellman"")............................... no. 4,200,770
public key cryptographic apparatus
and method (""hellman-merkle"").................... no. 4,218,582
cryptographic communications system and
method (""rsa"")................................... no. 4,405,829
exponential cryptographic apparatus
and method (""hellman-pohlig"").................... no. 4,424,414
pkp claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key
cryptography. the two businesses are rather closely related (for
example, the same person, jim bidzos, is president of both of them.)
pkp has licensed this technology to a considerable number of
companies (ibm, dec, motorola, at t, lotus...) for use in their
products. pkp has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their
patents.
ripem was originally created with no connection to rsadsi other than
its use of the rsaref library, and for no reason other than its
author's desire to see widespread use of public-key cryptography.
however, after the ball started rolling, people at rsadsi got
interested. rsadsi decided to carry ripem on its ftp site, and some
people there started making their own ripem keys and contributing
code. ripem even won the ""best application built on rsaref in 1992""
award.
12) why do all ripem public keys look very similar?
ripem public keys begin with a pkcs (public-key cryptography
standards) identifier describing various characteristics about the
key, so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as
those of lots of other people's keys. this does not mean your keys
are similar, but only that they are the same class of key, were
generated with the same program, are of the same length, etc.
13) what is pgp?
pgp is another cryptographic mail program called pretty good privacy.
pgp has been around longer than ripem, and works somewhat differently.
pgp is not compatible with ripem in any way, though pgp does also use rsa.
a few major differences between pgp and ripem:
- pgp has more key management features, particularly for users without
a direct network connection.
- ripem conforms to the pem rfcs and thus has a greater probability
of working with other pem software. pgp makes no attempt to be
compatible with anything other than itself.
- ripem uses rsaref, a library of rsa routines from rsadsi which
comes with a license allowing noncommercial use. pgp uses its own
implementation of rsa. pkp claims that it is a violation of its
patents to ""make, use or sell"" pgp in the u.s. or canada without
either a license or written permission. (see: ""disclaimer"")
(see: ""what about rsadsi pkp?"") phil zimmermann, the author of
pgp, stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal
action; he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged, but
it hasn't happened and there seems little prospect of it happening
in the future. he acknowledges in the pgp user's guide: in fact, if you live in the usa, and you are not a federal agency, you shouldn't actually run pgp on your computer, because public key partners wants to forbid you from running my software. pgp is contraband.
- both pgp and ripem are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside
the u.s. and canada without an export license. however, pgp
already exists on many ftp sites in europe and other places.
whether you use pgp or ripem or whatever, the documentation to pgp is
recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.
unfortunately, it's not distributed separately from the program,
which can be difficult to find in the u.s. on ftp sites due to
liability concerns.
14) what about rpem?
rpem stands for rabin privacy enhanced mail. it was similar to ripem,
but used a public-key cipher invented by rabin (which is not rsa) in
an attempt to avoid the patents on public-key systems. it was
written by mark riordan, who later wrote ripem.
its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many
(including rabin), pkp claimed that their patents were broad enough
to cover the cipher employed. this claim is not universally
accepted, but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons.
rpem is not really used anymore. it is not compatible with ripem or pgp.
15) what is mime?
mime stands for multipurpose internet mail extensions, and is
described in rfc 1341. you can find out about it in the newsgroup
comp.mail.mime; a faq exists on it. how pem should interact with
mime is not yet entirely clear; some people use the stopgap solution
of having a mime type application x-ripem in order to send ripem
messages as mime ones. i hope some standards will emerge. draft
internet documents exist on the matter.
16) what is tis pem?
trusted information systems is working on a version of privacy
enhanced mail for general availability. last i heard, it was
rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent (mh)
rather than a stand-alone system, and in beta test. i don't know
much more than that.
17) i have this simple way to defeat the security of ripem...
you may wish to check the companion post ""ripem-attacks"" which
discusses some of the more obvious attacks on ripem's security and
what procedures will minimize the risk. ripem's main ""weak area"" is
probably key distribution."
14832.eml,sci.crypt,"some possible attacks on ripem
this is a living list of potential weaknesses to keep your eyes open
for when using ripem for secure electronic mail. it does not go into
great detail, and is almost certainly not exhaustive. obviously, many
of the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in
general, and will pertain to secure mail programs other than ripem.
it is maintained by marc vanheyningen it
is posted monthly to a variety of news groups; followups pertaining
specifically to ripem should go to alt.security.ripem.
cryptanalysis attacks
- breaking rsa would allow an attacker to find out your private key,
in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign
messages with your private key.
rsa is generally believed to be resistant to all standard
cryptanalytic techniques. even a standard key (about 516 bits with
ripem) is long enough to render this impractical, barring a
huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring.
- breaking des would allow an attacker to read any given message,
since the message itself is encrypted with des. it would not allow
an attacker to claim to be you.
des has only 56 bits in its key, and thus could conceivably be
compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware, but few agencies
have such money to devote to simply read one message. since each
message has a different des key, the work for each message would
remain high.
key management attacks
- stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking
rsa. to safeguard it, it is encrypted with a des key which is derived
from a passphrase you type in. however, if an attacker can get a copy
of your private keyfile and your passphrase (by snooping network
packets, tapping lines, or whatever) he could break the whole scheme.
the main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the
private key file across an untrusted link. so don't do that. run
ripem on a trusted machine, preferably one sitting right in front of
you. ideally, your own machine in your own home (or maybe office)
which nobody else has physical access to.
- fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could
allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him
rather than to the real recipient. if the enemy can fool your
intended recipient as well, he could re-encrypt the messages with
the other bogus public key and pass them along.
it is important to get the proper public keys of other people.
the most common mechanism for this is finger; assuming the opponent
has not compromised routers or daemons or such, finger can be
given a fair amount of trust. the strongest method of key
authentication is to exchange keys in person; however, this is
not always practical. having other people ""vouch for you"" by
signing a statement containing your key is possible, although
ripem doesn't have features for doing this as automatically as
pgp. ripem does generate and check md5 fingerprints of public keys
in the key files; they may be exchanged via a separate channel for
authentication.
playback attacks
- even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography, an opponent could
still cause difficulties. for example, suppose you send a message
with mic-only (a pem mode which does not provide disclosure protection)
to alice which says ""ok, let's do that."" your opponent intercepts
it, and now resends it to bob, who now has a message which is
authenticated as from you telling him to do that. of course, he may
interpret it in an entirely different context. or your opponent
could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later,
figuring it would be seen differently at a later time. or the
opponent could change the originator-name: to himself, register
your public key as his, and send a message hoping the recipient
will send him return mail indicating (perhaps even quoting!) the
unknown message.
to defeat playback attacks, the plaintext of each message should
include some indication of the sender and recipient, and a unique
identifier (typically the date). a good front-end script for ripem
should do this automatically (imho). as a recipient, you should be
sure that the originator-name: header and the sender indicated within
the plaintext are the same, that you really are a recipient, and that
the message is not an old one. some this also can and should be
automated. the author of this faq has made a modest attempt at
automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated
headers; the programs are included in the standard distribution in
the utils directory.
local attacks
- clearly, the security of ripem cannot be greater than the security of
the machine where the encryption is performed. for example, under
unix, a super-user could manage to get at your encrypted mail,
although it would take some planning and effort to do something like
replace the ripem executable with a trojan horse or to get a copy of
the plaintext, depending how it's stored.
in addition, the link between you and the machine running ripem is
an extension of that. if you decrypt with ripem on a remote machine
which you are connected to via network (or, worse yet, modem), an
eavesdropper could see the plaintext (and probably also your
passphrase.)
ripem should only be executed on systems you trust, obviously. in
the extreme case, ripem should only be used on your own machine,
which you have total control over and which nobody else has access
to, which has only carefully examined software known to be free of
viruses, and so on. however, there's a very real trade-off between
convenience and security here.
a more moderately cautious user might use ripem on a unix workstation
where other people have access (even root access), but increase
security by keeping private keys and the (statically linked, of
course) executable on a floppy disk.
some people will keep ripem on a multi-user system, but when dialing
in over an insecure line, they will download the message to their
own system and perform the ripem decryption there. however, the
security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory; since
you presumably type your cleartext password to log in, you've just
given away the store, since the attacker can now log in as you and
install traps in your account to steal your private key next time
you use it from a less insecure line. this will likely remain the
situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of
cleartext password authentication.
i find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully i manage my
security arrangement in my .plan next to my public key, so that
potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are
in place. some people use two keys, a short one which is not
carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated
with greater care for critical correspondence.
untrusted partner attacks
- ripem's encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key
corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the
traffic. however, once someone with that key gets the message, she
may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes. there
exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient, say, taking an
encrypted message and converting it to a mic-only message, signed by
you and readable by anyone, although ripem does not provide this
functionality. indeed, the latest pem draft i have seen specifically
states that such transformations should be possible to allow
forwarding functions to work.
including the recipients in the plaintext, as mentioned above, will
make it possible for recipients of a redistributed message to be aware
of its original nature. naturally, the security of the cryptography
can never be greater than the security of the people using it."

14984.eml,sci.crypt,"(regarding the sufficient overwriting of media (""clearing"") meant to
be retained within the controlled environment, or declassifying
the material to be reused outside the controlled environment,)
from national telecommunications and information systems
security (ntiss) ""advisory memorandum on office automation
security guidelines"" (ntissam compusec 1 87):
""7.6.2.1 clearing of magnetic media
certain types of removable media (e.g., magnetic tape, floppy disk,
cassettes, and magnetic cards) may be cleared by overwriting the
entire media one time with any one character. floppy disks may be
cleared by applying a vendor's formatting program that overwrites
each location with a given character.
fixed media (e.g., winchester disks) should be cleared by overwriting
at least one time with any one character. one way to do this is by
applying a vendor-supplied formatting program that overwrites each
location on the disk with a given character, if it can be shown that
this program actually works as advertised. the user should beware:
some programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not
actually do this.
cleared media may be resides within the controlled facility or
released for destruction; however, they should be marked and
controlled at the level of the most restrictive sensitivity of
information ever recorded.
7.6.2.2 declassification of magnetic media
certain types of removable media can be declassified using a
degaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media of
that type. (a list of approved devices is maintained by the nsa.)
if a fixed medium (for example, a hard, or winchester, disk) is
operative, an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to
employ an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all
addressable locations at least three times by writing any character,
then its complement (e.g., binary ones and binary zeros)
alternatively.
when fixed media become inoperative, it is impossible to declassify
the media by the overwrite method. in this case, there are two
alternate procedures that may be used: (1) disassemble the disk
pack, and degauss each platter with the appropriate approved
degaussing equipment; and (2) courier the inoperative media to the
vendor's facility, have the magnetic media (e.g., disk platter)
removed in sight of the courier and returned to the courier for
destruction at the secure site. the vendor can then install new
platters and repair any other problems with the disk unit.

14987.eml,sci.crypt,"i hate to follow up to my own posting, but i should perhaps clarify
some things so i won't get flamed.
first of all, when i'm talking about factoring the modulus'' or a breakthrough in factoring'', what i really mean is a breakthrough in
the cryptanalysis of rsa. i know that factoring and breaking rsa are
not proven to be equivalent; it's just so damn convenient not to
repeat this every time.
i also have to admit that i don't really know if the non-group''
property of a cipher is essential only for key chaining. i have
thought about it a little while, but i can't find a way that a
cryptanalyst could exploit a group structure. that, of course, means
nothing at all.
then i wrote,
what i meant was that as long as the only advantage of the
cryptanalyst is a faster computer, then we will probably have rsa for
a long time to come, because even if 1024-bit moduli somehow could be
broken with fast computers (not with a new algorithm), then people
would simply use longer moduli. both users and cryptanalysts benefit
from better technology in the same way.
hope this keeps the flames away... have fun.

pgp 2.2 public key available on request. note the expiration date."
14988.eml,sci.crypt,"after ibm had invented the des and the nbs had advertised for proposals,
but before ibm had decided to respond, i argued strenuously that they
should not; they should keep it proprietary.
the biggest proponent of proposing was dr. lewis branscomb. dr. branscomb
was the ibm chief scientist and had come to ibm from nbs. fortunately
for all of us, dr. branscomb understood the answer to the above question
much better than i. he realized how difficult it would be to gain
acceptance for any cryptographic mechanism. because of the necessary
complexity, publicity would not be sufficient and neither would
authority. in fact, it has taken both of those plus more than 15
years.
we have also had independence. the des was solicited by nbs, invented
and proposed by ibm, and vetted by nbs. it has also been examined and
vetted by experts like adi shamir, who are not subject to influence by
any of these.
even now, there are still people posting on this list who do not trust
the des in spite of all the time, all of the analysis, and all of the
public scrutiny.
(of course, it is just this point that nist misses when it attempts to
gain acceptance for a novel mechanism, developed in secret, on the basis
of authority alone.)
we had a long thread here about whether or not the nsa can ""break"" the
des. that is a silly question. at some cost and in some time they
can ""break"" anything. the important question is at what cost and in
what time.
the fundamental strength of the des and rsa are not nearly so important
as what we know about their strength. as long as we understand the
cost and duration for an attacker, then we can use them in a safe way.
at this point, we may never replace either because of the inability of
any successor to overcome this knowledge gap.
des and rsa are among the most significant inventions of the century
and the most important inventions in the history of cryptography.
we are damned lucky to have them.

14993.eml,sci.crypt,"this actually supports bill's speculation - if there is a backdoor in
rsaref and if pkp is supported secretly by the nsa, then it is more
than natural that they will welcome any public-key implementation that
uses rsaref and will strongly oppose themselves against any
implementation that doesn't.
i personally cannot see how one could put a backdoor in a
long-precision modular arithmetic library that comes in source, but,
of course, the fact that -i- cannot see it means nothing...

do not believe that rsa would consent to such.
however, there are other limitation in the concept of rsaref in which
nsa has an interest. it has an interest in a limited number of
implementations, i.e., targets. it has an interest in fixed key or
maximum modulus size.
it has a legitimate (literally) right to pursue such interests. within
bounds, it probably has a right to pursue those interests by covert
means. at least it has the same right as the rest of us not to disclose
all of its motives and intentions. (institutions are not self-aware;
they do not know their intentions in any meaningful sense.)

14999.eml,sci.crypt,"the law is much worse than worthless. it gives police the power to put
innocent people in jail because they (the police) find something they don't
understand. most police don't know what the return key does, never mind the
difference between a core file and classified military secrets.
there are plenty of scenarios where the user would have no idea what something
is either. it could be uninitialized junk. the burden of proof is on the
user to show that it's something a normal upstanding citizen should have. no
one should ever be put in that situation, especially in america.
what's disgusting about this is how easily most people go along with it, to
provide a bargaining chip against some hypothetical alleged child molester
or drug dealer, or whatever bad thing is in style at the time. basically most
people don't have a clear distinction between criminals and suspects.
as an analogy, it's like they find a loose screw in your house, and they
insist that you're building a bomb or machine gun. they ask you where it came
from (like you'd know), and ask you to prove your claim. when you explain it
in such simple terms, people may start to get the idea.
as a matter of fact, i do keep random files on my disk. the reason is,
without special-purpose hardware, it takes a long time to generate good random
bits. i have programs that crank out a couple bits per minute, which is
pretty conservative, but over time that's more than i need.
if you think about it, there's no point in actually encrypting random data,
because it just gives you different random data. if you want some data to
look like an encrypted file, you just put an appropriate header on it. if
enough people do this, some of them will be put in jail.
when you get arrested and the police ask for your keys, you can tell them it's
just random junk, although of course they won't believe you. while you're
sitting in jail, you can take consolation in the fact that the government will
burn a few cpu-years trying to find something that's not there.

it a step further. write yourself a minimal ""file system"" program that
is used to create delete files, en decrypt them to ramdisk, list a
directory. put the util, password protected, on a floppy.
the catch is that the storage space used by this util is not part
of the dos file system. instead, defrag your disk, thus packing all
allocated clusters into clusters 0-n. then use the back end of the
partition to hold your 'stealth' file system. or, leave a small 2nd
partition on the disk that is not assigned to dos. another approach
might be to use a directory that contains a set of invariant files (dos
system files, for instance). due to dos allocating a minimum storage
unit of a ""cluster"" there is unused physical space on the disk between
the tail end of each file and the end of its associated cluster. these
dead spaces could be concatenated and used to hold your stealth file
system.
now you have a situation where no encrypted data ""appears"" on your

no bearing on the veracity of that phrase.

voice exemplars, and to take blood and dna tests.
no, but they could compell you to produce the key to a safe where, as it
happens, evidence that will convict you is stored.
the crypto-key disclosure issue hasn't come up yet, but current law
suggests that it's a loser for the defendant--he'll be compelled to turn
over the key.
the test for compelled self-incrimination is whether the material to
be disclosed in itself tends to inculpate the discloser. in the example
i gave above, the safe key itself has no testimonial value--ergo, it can
be disclosed under compulsion (e.g., subpoena duces tecum).
moreover, the government can always immunize the disclosure of a crypto
key--compelling you to disclose the key at the price of not using the fact
of your disclosure as evidence in the case against you. of course, they
can use whatever they discover as a result of this disclosure against
you.

generally, today people's identity' on the internet is primarily
determined by their email address in the sense that this is their
most unchanging 'face' in the electronic realm. this is your
login name qualified by the complete address domain information,
for example people see
this address when receiving mail or reading usenet posts from you
and in other situations where programs record usage. some obsolete
forms of addresses (such as bitnet) still persist.
in email messages, additional information on the path that a message
takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient. this
information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the
transmission and is a very accurate trace of its origination. this
type of identify-and-forward protocol is also used in the usenet
protocol to a lesser extent. forging these fields requires
corrupted mailing software at sites involved in the forwarding and
is very uncommon. not so uncommon is forging the chain at the
origination point, so that all initial sites in the list are faked
at the time the message is created. tracing these messages can be
difficult or impossible when the initial faked fields are names of
real machines and represent real transfer routes. why is identity (un)important on the internet?
the concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication,
privacy, and security, which in turn are all critical aspects of
computer networks. for example, the convenience of communication
afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for
identification. but there are many potential abuses of identity
possible that can have very severe consequences, with massive
computer networks at the forefront of the issue, which can
potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems.
verifying that an identity is correct is called authentication',
and one classic example of the problems associated with it is
h.g.well's war of the worlds'' radio broadcast that fooled
segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was
in progress. hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on usenet and
forged identities makes them more insidious. people and their
reputations can be assaulted by forgery.
however, the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of
its most attractive features. identity is just as useful as it is
harmful. a professor might carefully explain a topic until he
finds he is talking to an undergraduate. a person of a particular
occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally
shun him. some prejudices are erased, but, on the other hand, many
prejudices are useful! a scientist might argue he can better
evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more
about the authors. likewise, he may be more likely to reject it
based on unfair or irrelevant criteria. on the other side of the
connection, the author may find identities of reviewers useful in
exerting pressure for acceptance.
identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating credit' (not necessarily financial) and ownership' and usage'.
many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques
for identification. heavy reliance will be placed on digital
authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic.
many government functions and services are based on identification,
and law enforcement frequently hinges on it. hence, employees of
many government organizations push toward stronger identification
structures. but when does identification invade privacy?
the growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive
proportions. decisions made now on issues of identity will affect
many future users, especially as the network becomes increasingly
global, universal, widespread, and entrenched; and the positive or
adverse affects of these actions, intended and inadvertent, will
literally be magnified exponentially. how does my email address (not) identify me and my background?
your email address may contain information that influences people's
perceptions of your background. the address may identify' you as
from a department at a particular university, an employee at a
company, or a government worker. it may contain your last name,
initials, or cryptic identification codes independent of both. in
the us some are based on parts of social security numbers. others
are in the form 'u2338' where the number is incremented in the
order that new users are added to the system.
standard internet addresses also can contain information on your
broad geographical location or nationhood. however, none of this
information is guaranteed to be correct or be there at all. the
fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on
rather arbitrary organization, such as (mostly invisible) network
cabling distributions. the only point to make is that early fields
in the address are more specific (such as specific computer names
or local networks) and the later ones the most general (such as
continental domains). typically the first field is the name of the
computer receiving mail.
gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an
inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise. (for more
information, see the faqs on email addresses and known
geographical distributions below.) however, unix utilities exist
to aid in the quest (see the question on this).

.mil military site how can i find out more about somebody with a given email address?
one simple way is to send email to that address, asking. another
way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address (i.e. although the postmaster's job is more to help
find user id's of particular people given their real name and solve
mail routing problems. the sysadmin (i.e. may also
be able to supply information. users with related email address
may have information. however, all of these methods rely on the
time and patience of others so use them minimally.
one of the most basic tools for determining identity over the
internet is the unix utility 'finger'. the basic syntax is:
finger this utility uses communication protocols to query the computer
named in the address for information on the user named. the
response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may
be in any format. possible responses are as follows:
- a message unknown host' meaning some aspect of the address is
incorrect, two lines with no information and '???'.
- a message 'in real life: ???' in which case the receiving computer
could not find any kind of a match on the username. the finger
utility may return this response in other situations.
- a listing of information associated with multiple users. some
computers will search only for matching user ids, others will
attempt to find the username you specified as a substring of all
actual full names of users kept in a local database.
at some sites 'finger' can be used to get a list of all users on the
system with a finger address'. in general this is often
considered weak security, however, because attackers' know valid
user id's to crack' passwords.
more information on the fields returned by finger' is given below.
more information on finger' and locating people's email addresses
is given in the email faq (such as the whois lookup utility). just
as you can use these means to find out about others, they can use
them to find out about you. you can finger' yourself to find out
what is publicly reported by your unix system about you. be
careful when modifying finger' data; virtually anyone with
internet access worldwide can query this information. in one
amazing case, the new york times writer j. markoff uncovered the
identity of r. morris, author of the internet worm, through
the use of an anonymous tip and 'finger'. see the book cyberspace
by k. hafner and j. markoff. why is identification (un)stable on the internet?
generally, identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept
on the internet for a variety of reasons. one is the inherent
fluidity of cyberspace' where people emerge and submerge
frequently, and absences are not readily noted in the community'.
most people remember faces and voices, the primary means of casual
identification in the 'real world'. the arbitary and cryptic
sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are
not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique
identification of an individual, who may use multiple accounts on
multiple machines anywhere in the world.
currently internet users do not really have any great assurances
that the messages in email and usenet are from who they appear to
be. a person's mailing address is far from an identification of an
individual.
- anyone with access to the account, e.g. they know the password,
either legitimately or otherwise, can send mail with that address
in the from: line.
- email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as
they switch jobs or make moves inside their organizations.
- as part of current mailing protocol standards, forging the from:
line in mail messages is a fairly trivial operation for many
hackers.
the status and path information prepended to messages by
intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable. in general, while
possible, forgeries are fairly rare on most newsgroups and in
email. besides these pathological cases abve there are many basic
problems with today's internet protocols affecting identification
on the internet:
- internet mail standards, described in rfc-822, are still evolving
rapidly and not entirely orderly. for example, standards for
mail address munging' or parsing' tend to vary slightly between
sites and frequently mean the difference between finding
addresses and bouncing mail.
- domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites,
and there are delays in the propagation of this data.
- addresses cannot be resolved when certain critical computers
crash, such as the receiving computer or other computers involved
in resolving names into addresses called nameservers'.
- a whole slew of problems is associated with nameservers'; if
they are not updated they will not find name addresses, and even
the operation of what constitutes updating' has different
interpretations at different sites.
the current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly
anachronistic in that they were created when the network was
somewhat obscure and not widespread, with only a fraction of the
traffic it now sees. today a large proportion of internet traffic
is email, comprising millions of messages. what is the future of identification on the internet?
some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images
and voice messages into mail and these will improve the sense of
community that comes from the familiarity of identification.
however, they are not currently widespread, require large amounts
of data transfer, standardized software, and make some compromises
in privacy.
promising new cryptographic techniques may make 'digital signatures'
and 'digital authentication' common (see below). also, the trend
in usenet standards is toward greater authentication of posted
information. on the other hand, advances in ensuring anonymity
(such as remailers) are forthcoming. see below.
privacy what is privacy' on the internet?
generally, while privacy' has multiple connotations in society and
perhaps even more on the internet, in cyberspace most take it to
mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the
data stored on and and directed to it (such as email), and you do
not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches. in other words,
others may obtain data associated with your account, but not
without your permission. these ideas are probably both fairly
limiting and liberal in their scope in what most internet users
consider their private domains. some users don't expect or want
any privacy, some expect and demand it. why is privacy (un)important on the internet?
this is a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic, arousing
passionate opinions. on the internet, some take privacy for
granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent.
most governments have rules that protect privacy (such as the
illegal search and seizure clause of the u.s. constitution, adopted
by others) but have many that are antithetical to it (such as laws
prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping). these
rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules
governing it. however, the legal repercussions of the global
internet are still largely unknown and untested (i.e. no strong
legal precedents and court cases). the fact that internet traffic
frequently passes past international boundaries, and is not
centrally managed, significantly complicates and strongly
discourages its regulation. how (in)secure are internet networks?
- theoretically' people at any site in the chain of sites with
access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the
internet could potentially monitor or archive it. however, the
sheer volume and general 'noise' inherent to this data makes
these scenarios highly improbable, even by government agencies
with supposedly vast funding and resources.
- technologies exist to tap' magnetic fields given off by
electrical wires without detection. less obscurely, any machine
with a network connection is a potential station for traffic
detection, but this scenario requires knowledge and access to
very low-level hardware (the network card) to pursue, if even
possible.
- a company network general inc. is one of many that manufactures
and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can
'filter' and read packets by arbitrary criteria for
troubleshooting purposes, but the cost of this type of device is
prohibitive for casual use.
known instances of the above types of security breaches at a major
scale (such as at network hubs) are very rare. the greatest risks
tend to emerge locally. note that all these approaches are almost
completely defused with the use of cryptography. how (in)secure is my account?
by default, not very. there are a multitude of factors that may
reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet.
first, your account must be secure from other users. the universal
system is to use a password, but if it is weak' (i.e. easy to
guess) this security is significantly diminished. somewhat
surprisingly and frighteningly to some, certain users of the
system, particularly the administrator, generally have unlimited
access regardless of passwords, and may grant that access to
others. this means that they may read any file in your account
without detection.
furthermore, not universally known, most unix systems keep fairly
extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in, what
commands you execute, and when they are executed (in fact, login
information is usually public). most features of this auditing' or process accounting' information are enabled by default after the
initial installation and the system administrator may customize it
to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims.
this information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting
purposes and may otherwise be ignored. this data tracks
unsuccessful login attempts and other 'suspicious' activities on
the system. a traditional part of the unix system that tracks user
commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of
symbolic links (described in 'man ln').
unix implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features
and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies
regularly. typically system adminstrators augment the basic unix
functionality with public-domain programs and locally-developed
tools for monitoring, and use them only to isolate suspicious'
activity as it arises (e.g. remote accesses to the 'passwd' file, incorrect
login attempts, remote connection attempts, etc.).
generally, you should expect little privacy on your account for
various reasons:
- potentially, every keystroke you type could be intercepted by
someone else.
- system administrators make extensive backups that are completely
invisible to users which may record the states of an account over
many weeks.
- erased files can, under many operating systems, be undeleted.
- most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or
otherwise; for example ftp sites usually log the commands and
record the domain originations of users, including anonymous
ones.
- some software exacerbates these problems. see the section on x windows (in)security''.
indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users, a much
more commonly harmful threat. there are multiple ways to help
ensure that your account will not be accessed by others, and
compromises can often be traced to failures in these guidelines:
- choose a secure password. change it periodically.
- make sure to logout always.
- do not leave a machine unattended for long.
- make sure no one watches you when you type your password.
- avoid password references in email.
- be conservative in the use of the .rhost file.
- use utilities like xlock' to protect a station, but be
considerate.
be wary of situations where you think you should supply your
password. there are only several basic situations where unix
prompts you for a password: when you are logging in to a system or
changing your password. situations can arise in which prompts for
passwords are forged by other users, especially in cases where you
are talking to them (such as internet relay chat). also, be aware
that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain
passwords.
(thanks to jim mattson for contributions
here.) how (in)secure are my files and directories?
the most important privacy considerations are related to file
rights, and many lapses can be traced to their misunderstood nature
or haphazard maintenance. be aware of the rights associated with
your files and directories in unix. if the x' ( execute') right on
your parent directory is off for users, groups, and other, these
users cannot gain information on anything in your directories.
anything less may allow others to read, change, or even delete
files in your home directory. the rights on a directory supersede
the rights associated with files in that directory. for a
directory, 'x' means that access to the files (or subdirectories)
in the directory is possible -- if you know their names. to list
the contents of the directory, however, requires the 'r' right.
by default most accounts are accessable only to the owner, but the
initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator
preference. the default file mode specifies the initial rights
associated with newly created files, and can be set in the shell
with umask'. the details of rights implementations tend to vary
between versions of unix. consult man pages on chmod' and ls'.
examples
traver.lance ls -ld drwx------ 15 ld231782 1536 jan 31 21:22 users ld231782 here is a listing of the rights associated with a user's home
directory, denoted by '. the columns at the left identify what
rights are available. the first column identifies the entry as a
directory, and the next three columns mean that read, write, and
execute rights, respectively, are permitted for that user. for
directories, the x' right means that contents (file and
subdirectory names) within that directory can be listed. the
subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to
anything in the directory tree originating at that point. they
can't even see' any lower files or subdirectories; the hierarchy
is completely invisible to them.
traver.lance ls -l msg
-rw-r--r-- 1 ld231782 35661 jan 29 23:13 msg
traver.lance chmod u rw,g ,o msg
traver.lance ls -l msg
-rw------- 1 ld231782 35661 jan 29 23:13 msg
here the modes on the file msg' were changed to take away rights
from group' and other'.
note that ls -l ' requires both the 'r' right to get the list
of files and subdirectories, and the 'x' right to access the files
and subdirectories in order to get their size, etc. for example,
suppose the directory foo' has rights dr--r--r--, the following
is possible:
ls foo
these commands would fail independent of file rights:
ls -l foo
ls -l foo file
cat foo file
cd foo
if the directory foo' has rights d--x--x--x, the following are
possible if it is known beforehand that foo' contains an 'r'
readable file named file':
ls -l foo file
cat foo file
cd foo
the following commands fail:
ls foo
ls -l foo
(thanks to uwe waldmann for contributions here.) how (in)secure is x windows?
x windows is the primary software developed by the mit athena
project which is funded by u.s. government grants to develop
applications to harness the power of networks in enhancing
computational tasks, particularly the human-computer interface.
the software implements a client-server interface to a computer via
graphical windows. in this case the client' is the application
requesting or utilizing graphical resources (such as windows or a
mouse) and the server' is the machine that provides them. in many
situations the client is an application program running on the same
machine as the server.
the great utility of x windows comes from its complete dissociation
of the client and server so that windows may be broadcast' to a
server at a remote location from the client. unfortunately this
dynamic power also introduces many deep, intricate, and complicated
security considerations. the primary security and privacy issue
associated with x windows is that much more sensitive data may be
sent over a network, and over wider regions, than in the case where
the human is situated near the host computer. currently there is
no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in x
windows.
due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design
flaws, early versions of the x window system are extremely
insecure. anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt
that display or read it electronically based on access to the
device unix:0.0 by any regular user. there are no protections
from this type of access in these versions. the problem arises
because the security is completely based on machine addresses
rather than users, such that any user at a trusted' machine is
himself trusted. quoting from x documentation (man xsecurity):
with the access control list, the xhost' command may prevent some
naive attempts (i.e. those other than the direct-access unix:0.0
evasion); the syntax as typed on the host machine is xhost name '' where name is the domain name or internet address of an
authorized client machine. by default clients running nonlocal to
the host are disabled. public domain programs to disrupt a display
momentarily (such as 'flip' or slowly mirror the screen image, or
cause pixels to 'melt' down to the bottom) have been circulating on
the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks
on unsuspecting or inexperienced users. much more serious security
breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this
inherent weaknesses. (the minimal, easily-bypassed trusted'
security mode of xhost' has been jokingly referred to as x
hanging open, security terrible.'').
new versions of the x window system (x11r5 and higher) by default
make server access as secure as the file system using a .xauthority
file and 'magic cookies'. remote machines must have a code in the
.xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code
allowed by the server. many older programs and even new
vendor-supplied code does not support or is incompatible with magic cookies'. the basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to
monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of
keys occurs in transmission. x11r5 also includes other
sophisticated encryption mechanisms. try man xsecurity' to find
out what is supported at your site. even though improved security
mechanisms have been available in x windows since 1990, local
sites often update this software infrequently because installation
is extremely complex.
(thanks to marc vanheyningen jim mattson and bill marshall for contributions here.) how (in)secure is my email?
by default, not very. the characters that you are reading are
almost certainly encoded in ascii, the american standard code for
information interchange that maps alphabetic and symbolic
characters onto numeric codes and vice versa. virtually every
computer system uses this code, and if not, has ways of converting
to and from it. when you write a mail message, by default it is
being sent in ascii, and since the standard is virtually
universal, there is no intrinsic privacy. despite milleniums worth
of accumulated cryptographic knowledge, cryptographic technologies
are only recently being established that afford high priority to
privacy as a primary criteria in computer and network design. some
potential pitfalls in privacy are as follows:
- the most serious threats are instances of immature or unscrupulous
system operators reading private mail in the spool files' at a
local site (i.e. at the source or destination of the message),
such as a university.
- system administrators may also release files to law enforcement
agencies, but conventions and protocols for warrants involving
computer searches have still not been strongly established and
tested legally.
- note that bounced messages go to postmasters at a given site in
their entirety. this means that if you address mail with an
incorrect address it has a good chance of being seen by a human
other than the recipient.
- typically new user accounts are always set up such that the local
mail directory is private, but this is not guaranteed and can be
overridden.
- finally, be aware that some mailing lists (email addresses of
everyone on a list) are actually publicly accessable via mail
routing software mechanisms. this feature' can be disabled.
most potential compromises in email privacy can be thoroughly
avoided with the use of strong end-to-end cryptography, which has
its own set of caveats (for example, unscrupulous administrators
may still be a threat if the encryption site is shared or
nonlocal). see the sections on email privacy'' and email
policies.'' how am i (not) liable for my email and postings?
as punishment or whatever, your system administrator can revoke
certain privileges' such as emailing, usenet posting or reading
certain groups, file transferring, remote communications, or
generally any subset of capabilities available from your account.
this all is completely at the discretion of the local administrator
and under the procedures followed at a particular site, which in
many cases are haphazard and crisis-oriented. currently there are
virtually no widespread, uniform guidelines or procedures for
restricting use to any internet services, and local administrators
are free to make arbitrary decisions on access.
today punitive measures are regularly applied in various situations.
in the typical scenario complaint(s) reach a system adminstrator
regarding abuses by a user, usually but not necessarily preceded by
complaints to the user in email, regarding that person's
objectionable email or postings. abusive' posters to usenet are
usually first given admonitions from their system administrators as
urged by others on the net'. (the debate persists endlessly on
many newsgroups whether this is also used as a questionable means
of attacking or silencing harmless crackpots' or censoring
unpopular opinions.)
system administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to
'squelch' severe cases of abuse. in general, however, by tradition
usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of
the system, but a colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe
their alternatives when this patience is sapped: the options
wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next
message (referred to as hitting the n' key''), or to plonk'
annoying posters (according to the hacker's dictionary, the sound a
jerk makes at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file).
in cases where punitive actions are applied, generally system
administrators are least likely to restrict email. usenet postings
are much more commonly restricted, either to individual users or
entire groups (such as a university campus). restrictions are most
commonly associated with the following abuses':
- harassing or threatening notes, email terrorism'
- illegal uses, e.g. piracy or propagation of copyrighted material
- ad hominem' attacks, i.e. insulting the reputation of the
poster instead of citing the content of the message
- intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness
- inappropriate postings, esp. binary files in regular groups mail-bombing': inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive
files
major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and
official email or postings. most users have internet access via
accounts at businesses or universities and their activities on the
internet can be construed as representative of their parent
organizations. many people put disclaimers in their signatures' in
an attempt dissociate their identity and activities from parent
organizations as a precaution. a recent visible political case
involves the privacy of electronic mail written by white house
staff members of the bush administration. following are some
guidelines:
- acquaint yourself with your company or university policy.
- if possible, avoid use of your company email address for private
communication.
- use a disclaimer.
- keep a low profile (avoid flamewars' or simply don't post).
- avoid posting information that could be construed to be
proprietary or internal'.

notes on university liability for usenet. how do i provide more less information to others on my identity?
the public information of your identity and account is mostly
available though the unix utility finger' described above.
- you have control over most of this information with the utility chfn', the specifics vary between sites (on some systems use passwd -f').
- you can provide unlimited information in the .plan file which is
copied directly to the destination during the fingering.
- a technique that works at some sites allows you to find out who is
'finger'ing you and even to vary the .plan file sent to them.
- your signature is determined by the environment variable signature
- usenet signatures are conventionally stored in the .signature file
in your home directory.
providing less information on your online identity is more difficult
and involved. one approach is to ask your system adminstrator to
change or delete information about you (such as your full name).
you may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from
someone unrelated to you personally. you may be able to remotely
login (via modem or otherwise) to computers that you are not
physically near. these are tactics for hiding or masking your
online activities but nothing is foolproof. consult man pages on
the 'chmod' command and the default file mode. generally, files on
a shared system have good safeguards within the user pool but very
little protection is possible from corrupt system administrators.
to mask your identity in email or on usenet you can use different
accounts. more untraceable are new anonymous posting' and
remailing services that are very recently being established. see
below. who is my sysadmin? what does s he know about me?
the requirements and screening for getting a system administration
job (and thereby access to all information on a system) vary widely
between sites and are sometimes frighteningly lax, especially at
universities. many unix systems at universities are largely
managed by undergraduates with a background in computing and often hacking'. in general, commercial and industrial sites are more
strict on qualifications and background, and government sites are
extremely strict.
the system adminstrator (root user) can monitor what commands you
used and at what times. s he may have a record (backups) of files
on your account over a few weeks. s he can monitor when you send
email or post usenet messages, and potentially read either. s he
may have access to records indicating what hosts you are using,
both locally and elsewhere. administrators sometimes employ
specialized programs to track strange' or unusual' activity,
which can potentially be misused. why is privacy (un)stable on the internet?
for the numerous reasons listed above, privacy should not be an
expectation with current use of the internet. furthermore, large
parts of the internet are funded by the u.s. nsf (national science
foundation) which places certain restrictions on its use (such as
prohibiting commercial use). some high-level officials in this and
other government agencies may be opposed to emerging techniques to
guarantee privacy (such as encryption and anonymous services).
historically the major threats to privacy on the internet have been
local. perhaps the most common example of this are the widespread
occurrences of university administrators refusing to carry some
portion of usenet newsgroups labelled as pornographic'. the alternative' hierarchy in the usenet system, which has virtually
no restrictions on propagation and new group creation, is
frequently targeted (although this material may appear anywhere).
from the global point of view traffic is generally completely
unimpeded on the internet and only the most egregious offenders
are pursued. for example, verbatim transcriptions of copyrighted
material (such as newspaper or magazine articles) are posted to
usenet with regularity without major consequences (some email
complaints may ensue). more astonishing to some is that currently
significant portions of usenet traffic, and less so internet
traffic, is comprised of sexually-explicit digitized images almost
entirely originating from copyrighted material (newsgroups such as alt.sex' regularly have the highest traffic). what is the future of privacy on the internet?
some argue that the internet currently has an adequate or
appropriate level of privacy. others will argue that as a
prototype for future global networks it has woefully inadequate
safeguards. the internet is growing to become a completely global,
international superhighway for data, and this traffic will
inevitably entail data such as voice messages, postal mail, and
many other items of extremely personal nature. computer items that
many people consider completely private (such as their local hard
drives) will literally be inches from global network connections.
also, sensitive industrial and business information is exchanged
over networks currently and this volume may conceivably merge with
the internet.
most would agree that, for these basic but sensitive uses of the
internet, no significant mechanisms are currently in place to
ensure much privacy. new standards are calling for uniform
introduction of privacy enhanced mail' (pem) which uses encryption
technologies to ensure privacy, so that privacy protection is
automatic, and may significantly improve safeguards.
the same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy
(such as with surreptitious surveilance) can be overwhelmingly
effective in protecting it (e.g. with encryption). some government
agencies are opposed to unlimited privacy in general, and believe
that it should lawfully be forfeited in cases of criminal conduct
(e.g. court-authorized wiretapping). however, powerful new
technologies to protect privacy on computers are becoming
increasingly popular, provoking some to say that the cat is out
of the bag'' and the genie can't be put back in the bottle''. in
less idiomatic terms, they believe that the spread of strong
cryptography is already underway will be socially and technically
unstoppable.
to date, no feasible system that guarantees both secure
communication and government oversight has been proposed (the two
goals are largely incompatible). proposals for registration'' of
secret keys (by d. denning on sci.crypt, for example) have been met
with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at worst,
mainly because of concerns for the right to privacy and objections
of inherent feasibility. electronic privacy issues, and
particularly the proper roles of networks and the internet, will
foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few
years.
anonymity what is anonymity' on the internet?
simply stated, anonymity is the absence of identity, the
ultimate in privacy. however, there are several variations on
this simple theme. a person may wish to be consistently
identified by a certain pseudonym or handle' and establish a
reputation under it in some area, providing pseudo-anonymity.
a person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single
one-way message (a sort of hit-and-run'). or, a person may
wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with
others (with either known or anonymous identities) via an anonymous return address'. a user may wish to appear as a regular user' but actually be untraceable. sometimes a user
wishes to hide who he is sending mail to (in addition to the
message itself). the anonymous item itself may be directed at
individuals or groups. a user may wish to access some
service and hide all signs of the association.
all of these uses are feasible on the internet but are currently
tricky to carry out in practice, because of all the tracking
mechanisms inherent to operating systems and network protocols.
officials of the nsf and other government agencies may be opposed
to any of these uses because of the potential for abuse.
nevertheless, the inherent facelessness of large networks will
always guarantee a certain element of anonymity. why is anonymity' (un)important on the internet?
anonymity is another powerful tool that can be beneficial or
problematic depending on its use. arguably absence of
identification is important as the presence of it. it may be the
case that many strong benefits from electronic anonymity will be
discovered that were unforeseen and unpredicted, because true
anonymity has been historically very difficult to establish.
one can use anonymity to make personal statements to a colleague
that would sabotage a relationship if stated openly (such as
employer employee scenarios). one can use it to pass information
and evade any threat of direct retribution. for example, whistleblowers' reporting on government abuses (economic, social,
or political) can bring issues to light without fear of stigma or
retaliation. sensitive, personal, potentially damaging information
is often posted to some usenet groups, a risky situation where
anonymity allows conversations to be carried on completely
independent of the identities of the participants. some police
departments run phone services that allow anonymous reporting of
crimes; such uses would be straightforward on the network.
unfortunately, extortion and harassment become more insidious with
assurances of anonymity. how can anonymity be protected on the internet?
the chief means, as alluded to above, are masking identities in
email and posting. however, anonymous accounts (public accounts as
accessable and anonymous as e.g. public telephones) may be
effective as well, but this use is generally not officially
supported and even discouraged by some system adminstrators and nsf
guidelines. the nonuniformity in the requirements of obtaining
accounts at different sites and institutions makes anonymous
accounts generally difficult to obtain to the public at large.
many communications protocols are inherently detrimental to
anonymity. virtually every protocol in existence currently
contains information on both sender and receiver in every packet.
new communications protocols will likely develop that guarantee
much higher degrees of secure anonymous communication. what is anonymous mail'?
one approach to anonymizing' mail has been to set up an anonymous
server' that, when activated by email to its address, responds by
allocating and supplying an anonymous id' that is unique to the
person requesting it (based on his email address). this will vary
for the same person for different machine address email
originations. to send anonymous mail, the user sends email directed
to the server containing the final destination. the server anonymizes' the message by stripping of identification information
and forwards the message, which appears to originate from the
anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id.
this is the interactive' use of anonymity or pseudonymity
mentioned above.
another more fringe' approach is to run a cypherpunk' remailer
from a regular user account (no root system privileges are
required). these are currently being pioneered by eric hughes and
hal finney the operator runs a process on
a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain
characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail
(typically fields in the header). one has been implemented as a
perl script running on unix. several of these are in existence
currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable;
they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge.
the remailers don't generally support anonymous return addresses.
mail that is incorrectly addressed is received by the operator.
generally the user of the remailer has to disavow any
responsibility for the messages forwarded through his system,
although actually may be held liable regardless.
these approaches have several serious disadvantages and weaknesses:
- the anonymous server approach requires maintaining a mapping of
anonymous id's to real addresses that must be maintained
indefinitely. one alternative is to allow deallocation' of
aliases at the request of the user, but this has not been
implemented yet.
- although an unlikely scenario, traffic to any of these sites could
conceivably be monitored from the outside', necessitating the
use of cryptography for basic protection,.
- local administrators can shut them down either out of caprice or
under pressure from local, network, or government agencies.
- unscrupulous providers of the services can monitor the traffic
that goes through them.
- most remailers currently keep logs that may be inspected.
- the cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because these
operators are basically network users who do not own the
equipment and are accountable to their own system
administrators, who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic
to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation is discovered,
regarding it as illicit use.
- in all cases, a high degree of trust is placed in the anonymous
server operator by the user.
currently the most direct route to anonymity involves using smtp
protocols to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary
field information. this practice, not uncommon to hackers, and the
approach used by remailers, is generally viewed with hostility by
most system administrators. information in the header routing data
and logs of network port connection information may be retained
that can be used to track the originating site. in practice, this
is generally infeasible and rarely carried out. some
administrators on the network will contact local administrators to
request a message be tracked and its writer admonished or punished
more severely (such as revoking the account), all of this actually
happening occasionally but infrequently.
see the sections known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and responsibilities associated with anonymity''. what is anonymous posting'?
anonymous servers have been established as well for anonymous usenet
posting with all the associated caveats above (monitored traffic,
capricious or risky local circumstances, logging). make sure to
test the system at least once by e.g. anonymous posting to
misc.test (however some operators don't recommend this because many
sites autorespond' to test messages, possibly causing the
anonymous server to allocate anonymous ids for those machines).
see the responsibilties associated with anonymous posting''
before proceeding.
another direct route involves using nntp protocols to submit a
message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information.
this practice, not uncommon to hackers, is also generally viewed
with hostility by most system administrators, and similar
consequences can ensue.
see the sections known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and responsibilities associated with anonymity''. why is anonymity (un)stable on the internet?
as noted, many factors compromise the anonymity currently available
to the general internet community, and these services should be
used with great caution. to summarize, the technology is in its
infancy and current approaches are unrefined, unreliable, and not
completely trustworthy. no standards have been established and
troubling situations of loss of anonymity and bugs in the software
are prevalent. here are some encountered and potential bugs:
- one anonymous remailer reallocated already allocated anonymous
return addresses.
- others passed signature information embedded in messages
unaltered.
- address resolution problems resulting in anonymized mail bounced
to a remailer are common.
- forgeries to the anonymous server itself are a problem, possibly
allowing unauthorized users to potentially glean anon id - email
address mappings in the alias file. this can be remedied with
the use of passwords.
- infinite mail loops are possible with chaining remailers.
source code is being distributed, tested, and refined for these
systems, but standards are progressing slowly and weakly. the
field is not likely to improve considerably without official
endorsement and action by network agencies. the whole idea is
essentially still in its infancy and viewed with suspicion and
distrust by many on the internet, seen as illegitimate or favorable
to criminality. the major objection to anonymity over regular
internet use is the perceived lack of accountability to system
operators, i.e. invulnerability to account restrictions resulting
from outside complaints. system adminstrators at some sites have
threatened to filter anonymous news postings generated by the
prominent servers from their redistribution flows. this may only
have the effect of encouraging server operators to create less
characteristically detectable headers. probably the least
problematic approach, and the most traditional to usenet, is for
individual users to deal with anonymous mail however they prefer,
e.g. ignoring it or filtering it with kill files. what is the future of anonymity on the internet?
new anonymous protocols effectively serve to significantly increase
safeguards of anonymity. for example, the same mechanism that
routes email over multiple hosts, thereby threatening its privacy,
can also be used to guarantee it. in a scheme called chaining' an
anonymous message is passed through multiple anonymous servers
before reaching a destination. in this way generally multiple
links of the chain have to be broken' for security to be
compromised. re-encryption at each link makes this scenario even
more unlikely. even more significantly the anonymous remailers
could be spread over the internet globally so that local weaknesses
(such as corrupt governments or legal wiretapping within a nation)
would be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message
tracing. however, remailers run by corrupt operators are possible.
the future of anonymous services on the internet is, at this time,
highly uncertain and fraught with peril. while specific groups seem
to benefit significantly from anonymous posting capabilities, many
feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous posting is a
disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussions in serious' groups. the introduction of unlimited group anonymity
may have fundamental repercussions on usenet conventions and
distribution mechanisms such as moderated and alt' groups have had
in the past. for example, as part of new group creation, the
charter may specify whether anonymous' posting is (un)welcome.
nevertheless, the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may
be inevitable. based on traffic statistics, anonymous services are
in huge demand. pervasive and readily available anonymity could
carry significant and unforeseen social consequences. however, if
its use is continued to be generally regarded as subversive it may
be confined to the underground. the ramifications of widespread
introduction of anonymity to usenet are still largely unknown. it
is unclear whether it will provoke signficant amounts of new
traffic or, instead of expansion, cause a shift where a greater
portion of existing traffic is anonymized. conceivably the
services could play a role in influencing future mainstream social
acceptance of usenet. this is part 1 of the privacy anonymity faq, obtained via anonymous

the 'tcpdump' packet-tracing program is loosely based on smi's
""etherfind"" although none of the etherfind code remains. it was
originally written by van jacobson, lawrence berkeley laboratory,
as part of an ongoing research project to investigate and improve
tcp and internet gateway performance. a current version is
available via anonymous ftp from host ftp.ee.lbl.gov (currently at

with digital encryption and authentication technologies, the
possibility of a widespread digital cash system may someday be
realized. a system utilizing codes sent between users and banks
(similar to today's checking system except entirely digital) may
be one approach. the issues of cryptography, privacy, and
anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an
economy. see the article in scientific american by david chaum
( dec.1992).
an experimental digital bank is run by karl barrus based on suggestions by hal finney on the
cypherpunks mailing list. to use the server send mail to message with the following text:
::
command: help where is your email address. what is a hacker'' or cracker''?
these terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning,
especially on the internet. in the general news media in the past
a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as
breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker, but most
internet users prefer the term cracker'' for this. instead, a hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious,
curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a
system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and
patriot. this is the sense intended in this document. see also
the hacker's dictionary'' and the faq alt-security-faq'. what is a cypherpunk''?
from the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:
see information on the cypherpunk mailing list below.
see also the cryptoanarchist manifesto and the cryptography glossary
in soda.berkeley.edu: pub cypherpunks. what is steganography' and anonymous pools?
closely associated with encryption is steganography' or the
techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication
but concealing the very existence of the communication itself.
many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the
proliferation of computer technology. for example, it is possible
to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,
typically the most 'noisy'. in addition, when such an item is
posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually
untraceable communication can take place between sender and
receiver. for steganographic communications in the electronic
realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where
individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual
users decode particular messages with their unique key. an
anonymous pool has been set up by miron cuperman for experiments. send email to with one of the following
commands in the subject line:
subscribe
unsubscribe
help what is security through obscurity'? security through obscurity' refers to the attempt to gain
protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information
or programs relating to them. for example, a company may not make
public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade attacks' based on knowledge of it. another example would be
concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in
operating systems. or, some reliance may be made on the fact that
some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious
because they are not widely known'' or not widely used.'' this
argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and usenet
posting forgery'. security through obscurity' is regarded as a
very feeble technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at
worst (also called the head-in-the-sand approach''). see the faq
for alt.security.
some remarks of john perry barlow, cofounder of the electronic
frontier foundation, directed to nsa agents at the first
international symposium on national security national
competitiveness held in mclean, virginia dec. 1, 1992: what are identity daemons'?
rfc-931 describes a protocol standard that allows unix programs to
query a remote user's login name after connection to a local
communication socket (a connection of this type is established
during ftp and telnet sessions, for example). the standard is not
widely supported, perhaps 10 of internet sites currently implement
it but the number is increasing. the mechanism is detrimental to
anonymity. regular users cannot disable it but system
adminstrators can circumvent it. this standard may represent a
trend toward greater authentication mechanisms. what new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy?
remailing posting
- stable, secure, protected, officially sanctioned and permitted,
publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs.
- official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and usenet
postings.
- truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information
obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms (chaining,
encrypted addresses, etc.)
- standards for anonymous email addressing, embedding files, and
remailer site chaining.
general
- recognition of anonymity, cryptography, and related privacy
shields as legitimate, useful, desirable, and crucial by the
general public and their governments.
- widespread use and implementation of these technologies
by systems designers into
hardware, software, and standards, implemented securely,' seamlessly,' and transparently'.
- general shift of use, dependence, and reliance to means other than
wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement
agencies.
- publicity, retraction, and dissolution of laws and government
agencies opposed to privacy, replaced by structures dedicated to
strengthening and protecting it.
issues what is the electronic frontier foundation (eff)?
from ftp.eff.org: pub eff mission statement:
eff was started by the multimillionaire mitchell kapor, founder of
lotus software, and john barlow, lyricist for the grateful dead
rock band. a highly publicized endeavor of the organization
involved the legal defense of steve jackson games after an fbi
raid and an accompanying civil suit (see section on steve
jackson games''). the foundation publishes eff news (effector
online) electronically, send requests to in a letter to mitchell kapor from the chairman of the subcommittee
with primary jurisdiction over telecommunications policy dated
november 5, 1991, representative edward j. markey complemented
mitchell kapor on his insights on the development of a national
public information infrastructure'' which were appreciated greatly

the computer professionals for social responsibility have been
working to protect and promote electronic civil liberties issues
since 1982. the group has three offices (palo alto, cambridge,
washington, dc) and 20 chapters. it is involved in litigation
against the fbi, the nsa, nist, the secret service and other other
u.s. government agencies to declassify and provide documentation
on issues such as operation sundevil, the fbi wiretap proposal,
nsa's interference in crypography, the breakup of the 2600 raid in
arlington, va in nov 1992. members speak frequently in front on
congress, state legislators and public utility commissions to
testify on privacy, information policy, computer security, and
caller identification.
cpsr has created an extensive internet privacy library available
via ftp, gopher, wais, and email at cpsr.org, currently comprising
the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet. for
more information, anonymous ftp cpsr.org: cpsr .
(thanks to dave banisar for contributions
here.) what was operation sundevil' and the steve jackson game case?
in the early 1990's a fear spread among u.s. law enforcement agencies
on the illicit activities of hackers' and phreakers' involved in
such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery.
(see ftp.eff.org: pub sjg general information effector1.04):
massive show-trials' never materialized, although isolated
instances of prosecution were pursued. the movement reached a
crescendo in texas with the highly publicized case of illegal

condensation of information from various sources regarding privacy,
identity, and anonymity on the internet. the author is committed
to keeping this up-to-date and strengthening it, but this can only
be effective with your feedback. in particular, the following
items are sought:
- short summaries of rfc documents and other references listed,
esp. cpsr files.
- more data on the specific uses and penetration of rfc-931.
- internet traffic statistics. how much is email? how much
usenet? what are the costs involved?
- famous or obscure examples of compromised privacy
on the internet.
- ftp site for the code (not the code) to turn the .plan file into a
named pipe for sensing reacting to remote fingers'.
- knowledge on the promiscuous' mode of receipt or transmission

notes - cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often
running without site administrator knowledge. liability issues
are wholly unresolved.
- so far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and pgp
software (see the question on cryptography).
- encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)
vary between sites.
- multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are
mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time. what are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?
users
- use anonymity only if you have to. frivolous uses weaken the
seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.
- do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.
- do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on
usenet, such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.
- if posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.
remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases
network traffic.
- avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of usenet; this
is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. the alt'
hierarchy is preferred.
- give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.
references, etc.) remember that content is the only means for
readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any
inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even
future ones under the same handle.
- be careful not to include information that will reveal your
identity or enable someone to deduce it. test the system by
sending anonymized mail to yourself.
- be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them.
be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.
- be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity.
- hit-and-run'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation.
use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.
- be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large
amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating
his hardware, all for your convenience.
operators
- document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an
introductory file that is sent to new users. have a coherent and
consistent policy and stick to it. state clearly what logging and
monitoring is occurring. describe your background, interest, and
security measures. will the general approach be totalitarian or
lassaiz-faire?
- formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate
potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. what if a user
is blackmailing someone through your service? what if a user
posts suicidal messages through your service? remember, your
users trust you to protect them.
- in the site introductory note, give clear examples of situations
where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g.
warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke
the account, 'out' the user, contact local administrator, etc.)
- describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware.
address the bandwidth limitations of your site. report candidly
and thoroughly all bugs that have occurred. work closely with
users to isolate and fix bugs. address all bugs noted below under (in)stability of anonymity''.
- document the stability of the site---how long has it been running?
what compromises have occured? why are you running it? what is
your commitment to it?
- include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages. include an
address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item.
consult a lawyer about your liability.
- be committed to the long-term stability of the site. be prepared
to deal with complaints and hate mail' addressed to you. if you
do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system
adminstrator, consult those who do and are.
- be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups. if
possible, query group readers.
- keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message
format that can be screened effectively by kill files. ensure
the key text anon' is somewhere in every header.
- take precautions to ensure the security of the server from
physical and network-based attacks and infiltrations.
readers
- do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason
that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that
equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail
anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its
volume is heavy or increasing).
- react to the anonymous information unemotionally. abusive posters
will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate
responses. sometimes the most effective response is silence.
- notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy,
harassment, extortion, etc.
- do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they
offend you personally.
- use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the
idea of anonymity itself.
- avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings
should be barred from particular groups because no possible' or conceivable' need exists.

james thomas green note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask
anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so
far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common
as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering. what is the history behind anonymous posting servers?
originally anonymous posting services were introduced for
individual, particularly volatile newsgroups, where anonymity is
almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion
and alt.sex.bondage. one of the first was one by dave mack
started in 1988 for alt.sex.bondage. another early one was
wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by stephanie gilgut (gilgut enterprises)
but was disbanded due to lack of funds. the system provided
anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (john opalko) took up
the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous
alias file. the group alt.personals has been chewing through
servers like there's no tomorrow.''
spurred by the disappearance of wizvax' and interested in
researching the idea, karl kleinpaste developed his own system
from scratch in six hours. by this time the idea of extending the
server to new, more mainstream' groups was starting to emerge,
and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request by
multiple users for anonymity in other groups. the intended
advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group
support, with a single anon identifier across all. this was
arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.''
k. kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an
anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus
against it.
k. kleinpaste introduced what he calls a fire extinguisher'' to squelch' or plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and
used this in three cases. nevertheless, after a few months of
intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his
server. even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to
abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the
facilities staff here. such abuses started right after it was
created.''
in nov 1992, johan helsingius set up the most
controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on
scripts and c code written by k. kleinpaste and supports anonymized
mail, posting, and return addresses. he initially wanted to confine
the service to scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide
accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests.
j. helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every usenet
newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological
opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy).
because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium,
abuses by anonymous posters tend to have higher visibility than routine'' abuses. his total commitment to preservation of
anonymity is also controversial.
for example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in feb
1993, an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate
crew dialogue during the challenger shuttle disaster via
anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. despite that the transcript had been
posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then
non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a
new york news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of
vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity, reverberating
through many newsgroups.
the original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded
that the story seemed likely to have been fabricated,''
suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was
not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of
the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived
association with the item. the ensuing commotion generated queries
for the original article by late-entering readers. the anonymous
user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his
detractors.
despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal
opposition and verbal abuse of k. kleinpaste and eminent news
operators, j. helsingius has largely avoided use of the fire
extingisher'' and the group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the
scope of the service. as of march 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is
best described as inundated': it has registered over 13,000 users
in its initial three months of operation, forwards 3000 messages a
day, and approximately 5 of all usenet postings are anonymized
through the site. the immense popularity is probably largely due
to the capability for global' anonymity which has allowed users to
find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.
johan helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to
dismantle his server in feb 1993. at one point k. kleinpaste
threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate
news operators to send out revocation commands on all messages
originating from the site. j. helsingius has also alluded to
threats of flooding the server. the server has crashed several
times, at least once due to a saturation mailbombing' through it
by an anonymous user. mr. helsingius reports spending up to 5
hours per day answering email requests alone associated with the
service's administration. in response to the serious threats he
disabled global group access temporarily for one week and
encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.
based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by cypherpunks,'' j. helsingius has identified many security
weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is
currently in the process of code development and testing. he is
planning on upgrading the ibm compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon
to handle the voluminous load and is considering integrating a new
system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple
email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption,
etc.
a very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in dec.
1992 by d. clunie that used cryptography
in both directions (to from) the server for the highest degree of
confidentiality seen so far. however, it was running on a public
access account, and he had to shut it down after only several
weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately
originating from nsf representatives. d. clunie has released the
software to the public domain.
recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to whistleblowing' on
government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and
group formation is currently underway. in the basic scenario the
group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers,
and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable
digital signatures. the traffic may eventually reach reporters in
the mainstream news media. has volunteered to
attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing
easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and
encryption.

15183.eml,sci.crypt,"the white house
office of the press secretary for immediate release april 16, 1993
statement by the press secretary
the president today announced a new initiative that will bring
the federal government together with industry in a voluntary
program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law
enforcement.
the initiative will involve the creation of new products to
accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.
for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our
private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the
tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of
protecting americans. rather than use technology to accommodate
the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and
law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against
industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.
sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to
protect electronic funds transfer. it is now being used to
protect electronic mail and computer files. while encryption
technology can help americans protect business secrets and the
unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used
by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.
a state-of-the-art microcircuit called the ""clipper chip"" has
been developed by government engineers. the chip represents a
new approach to encryption technology. it can be used in new,
relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to
an ordinary telephone. it scrambles telephone communications
using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in
commercial use today.
this new technology will help companies protect proprietary
information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
electronically. at the same time this technology preserves the
ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to
intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.
a ""key-escrow"" system will be established to ensure that the
""clipper chip"" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding
americans. each device containing the chip will have two unique
2
""keys,"" numbers that will be needed by authorized government
agencies to decode messages encoded by the device. when the
device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately
in two ""key-escrow"" data bases that will be established by the
attorney general. access to these keys will be limited to
government officials with legal authorization to conduct a
wiretap.
the ""clipper chip"" technology provides law enforcement with no
new authorities to access the content of the private
conversations of americans.
to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the
attorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the new
devices. in addition, respected experts from outside the
government will be offered access to the confidential details of
the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
their findings.
the chip is an important step in addressing the problem of
encryption's dual-edge sword: encryption helps to protect the
privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield
criminals and terrorists. we need the ""clipper chip"" and other
approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access
to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it
to hide their illegal activities. in order to assess technology
trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),
the president has directed government agencies to develop a
comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:
employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;
calls and data, under proper court or other legal
order, when necessary to protect our citizens;
technology to build the national information
infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and
the competitiveness of american industry in the global
marketplace; and
high technology products.
the president has directed early and frequent consultations with
affected industries, the congress and groups that advocate the
privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.
3
the administration is committed to working with the private
sector to spur the development of a national information
infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer
technologies to give americans unprecedented access to
information. this infrastructure of high-speed networks
(""information superhighways"") will transmit video, images, hdtv
programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone
system transmits voice.
since encryption technology will play an increasingly important
role in that infrastructure, the federal government must act
quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding
its use. the administration is committed to policies that
protect all americans' right to privacy while also protecting
them from those who break the law.
further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.
the provisions of the president's directive to acquire the new
encryption technology are also available.

standards and technology, (301) 975-2758.
questions and answers about the clinton administration's
telecommunications initiative
q: does this approach expand the authority of government
agencies to listen in on phone conversations?
a: no. ""clipper chip"" technology provides law enforcement with
no new authorities to access the content of the private
conversations of americans.
q: suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
encrypted using the device. what would they have to do to
decipher the message?
a: they would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a
court order, to do the wiretap in the first place. they
would then present documentation of this authorization to
the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and
obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug
smugglers. the key is split into two parts, which are
stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key
escrow system.
q: who will run the key-escrow data banks?
a: the two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent
entities. at this point, the department of justice and the
administration have yet to determine which agencies will
oversee the key-escrow data banks.
q: how strong is the security in the device? how can i be sure
how strong the security is?
a: this system is more secure than many other voice encryption
systems readily available today. while the algorithm will
remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow
system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of
cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
potential users that there are no unrecognized
vulnerabilities.
q: whose decision was it to propose this product?
a: the national security council, the justice department, the
commerce department, and other key agencies were involved in
this decision. this approach has been endorsed by the
president, the vice president, and appropriate cabinet
officials.
q: who was consulted? the congress? industry?
a: we have on-going discussions with congress and industry on
encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify
as we carry out our review of encryption policy. we have
briefed members of congress and industry leaders on the
decisions related to this initiative.
q: will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?
a: the government designed and developed the key access
encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the
microcircuits to product manufacturers. product
manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip
manufacturer that produces them.
q: who provides the ""clipper chip""?
a: mykotronx programs it at their facility in torrance,
california, and will sell the chip to encryption device
manufacturers. the programming function could be licensed
to other vendors in the future.
q: how do i buy one of these encryption devices?
a: we expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating
the ""clipper chip"" into their devices.
q: if the administration were unable to find a technological
solution like the one proposed, would the administration be
willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
powerful encryption devices?
a: this is a fundamental policy question which will be
considered during the broad policy review. the key escrow
mechanism will provide americans with an encryption product
that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive
than others readily available today, but it is just one
piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to
encryption technology, which the administration is
developing.
the administration is not saying, ""since encryption
threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,
we will prohibit it outright"" (as some countries have
effectively done); nor is the u.s. saying that ""every
american, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
unbreakable commercial encryption product."" there is a
false ""tension"" created in the assessment that this issue is
an ""either-or"" proposition. rather, both concerns can be,
and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,
balanced approach such as is proposed with the ""clipper
chip"" and similar encryption techniques.
q: what does this decision indicate about how the clinton
administration's policy toward encryption will differ from
that of the bush administration?
a: it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption
technology in telecommunications and computing and are
committed to working with industry and public-interest
groups to find innovative ways to protect americans'
privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law
enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime
and terrorism.
q: will the devices be exportable? will other devices that use
the government hardware?
a: voice encryption devices are subject to export control
requirements. case-by-case review for each export is
required to ensure appropriate use of these devices. the
same is true for other encryption devices. one of the
attractions of this technology is the protection it can give
to u.s. companies operating at home and abroad. with this
in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a
case-by-case basis for u.s. companies seeking to use these
devices to secure their own communications abroad. we plan
to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability
of these products."

the white house
office of the press secretary for immediate release april 16, 1993
statement by the press secretary
the president today announced a new initiative that will bring
the federal government together with industry in a voluntary
program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law
enforcement.
the initiative will involve the creation of new products to
accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.
for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our
private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the
tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of
protecting americans. rather than use technology to accommodate
the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and
law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against
industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.
sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to
protect electronic funds transfer. it is now being used to
protect electronic mail and computer files. while encryption
technology can help americans protect business secrets and the
unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used
by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.
a state-of-the-art microcircuit called the ""clipper chip"" has
been developed by government engineers. the chip represents a
new approach to encryption technology. it can be used in new,
relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to
an ordinary telephone. it scrambles telephone communications
using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in
commercial use today.
this new technology will help companies protect proprietary
information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
electronically. at the same time this technology preserves the
ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to
intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.
a ""key-escrow"" system will be established to ensure that the
""clipper chip"" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding
americans. each device containing the chip will have two unique
2
""keys,"" numbers that will be needed by authorized government
agencies to decode messages encoded by the device. when the
device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately
in two ""key-escrow"" data bases that will be established by the
attorney general. access to these keys will be limited to
government officials with legal authorization to conduct a
wiretap.
the ""clipper chip"" technology provides law enforcement with no
new authorities to access the content of the private
conversations of americans.
to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the
attorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the new
devices. in addition, respected experts from outside the
government will be offered access to the confidential details of
the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
their findings.
the chip is an important step in addressing the problem of
encryption's dual-edge sword: encryption helps to protect the
privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield
criminals and terrorists. we need the ""clipper chip"" and other
approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access
to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it
to hide their illegal activities. in order to assess technology
trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),
the president has directed government agencies to develop a
comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:
employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;
calls and data, under proper court or other legal
order, when necessary to protect our citizens;
technology to build the national information
infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and
the competitiveness of american industry in the global
marketplace; and
high technology products.
the president has directed early and frequent consultations with
affected industries, the congress and groups that advocate the
privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.
3
the administration is committed to working with the private
sector to spur the development of a national information
infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer
technologies to give americans unprecedented access to
information. this infrastructure of high-speed networks
(""information superhighways"") will transmit video, images, hdtv
programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone
system transmits voice.
since encryption technology will play an increasingly important
role in that infrastructure, the federal government must act
quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding
its use. the administration is committed to policies that
protect all americans' right to privacy while also protecting
them from those who break the law.
further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.
the provisions of the president's directive to acquire the new
encryption technology are also available.

questions and answers about the clinton administration's
telecommunications initiative
q: does this approach expand the authority of government
agencies to listen in on phone conversations?
a: no. ""clipper chip"" technology provides law enforcement with
no new authorities to access the content of the private
conversations of americans.
q: suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
encrypted using the device. what would they have to do to
decipher the message?
a: they would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a
court order, to do the wiretap in the first place. they
would then present documentation of this authorization to
the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and
obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug
smugglers. the key is split into two parts, which are
stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key
escrow system.
q: who will run the key-escrow data banks?
a: the two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent
entities. at this point, the department of justice and the
administration have yet to determine which agencies will
oversee the key-escrow data banks.
q: how strong is the security in the device? how can i be sure
how strong the security is?
a: this system is more secure than many other voice encryption
systems readily available today. while the algorithm will
remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow
system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of
cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
potential users that there are no unrecognized
vulnerabilities.
q: whose decision was it to propose this product?
a: the national security council, the justice department, the
commerce department, and other key agencies were involved in
this decision. this approach has been endorsed by the
president, the vice president, and appropriate cabinet
officials.

15189.eml,sci.crypt,"means they aren't planning to make it public, as was done with des. as it
says in both sci.crypt faqs, there's no way we are going to achieve the
same level of comfort with clipper that we finally have with des if we
can't actually get our hands on the bits and watch them flow around. even

took biham and shamir to get a handle on just how good des is... and for

15190.eml,sci.crypt,"lets carry this one step further. suppose the text of the key is
in itself conclusive evidence of the same crime for which the
encrypted material is further evidence. i find myself envisaging a
scenario like this:
you have made some scans of peanuts strips. you encrypt them. the key
is a phrase.
the comic police haul you in. they seize your system. they find the
encrypted file.
cp: ""whats that file?""
you: ""i take the fifth.""
cp: ""what's the keyphrase to that file?""
you: ""i take the fifth.""
judge: ""you have to reveal the keyphrase"" i disagree, but i'm not a judge. you: ""your honor, revealing the keyphrase, in it's own right, would
tend to incriminate me of breaking laws, independent of what
may or may not be in the encrypted file.""
judge: ""i grant you immunity from whatever may be learned from the key
itself""
you: ""the keyphrase is: ""i confess to deliberately evading copyright;
the file encoded with this keyphrase contains illegal scans of
copyrighted peanuts strips.""""
judge and cp: ""oh.""
how will they get you now? i'm not saying that they won't, or
can't (or even that they shouldn't :-), but what legal mechanism will
they use? should we be crossposting this to misc.legal?
peter trei"
15191.eml,sci.crypt,"a nice formulation for the introduction of the first encryption
devices with built-in trapdoors - just like the feds wanted...
bla-bla.
indeed, and the current proposal does nothing to prevent the latter.
this doesn't say much. there are many incredibly weak encryption
algorithms in commercial use today...
except from the government.
nope. the criminals won't be stupid enough to use the new chip,
they'll use something secure. this technology provides only means to
intercept the phone conversations of people who are stupid enough to
use it.
that is, the government has the keys. it doesn't matter much if they
are in one or in two of its hands...
correct. it does, however, provide those americans with the false
sense of privacy.
if the screening is not public, it cannot be trusted. some people do
not trust des even today, after all the examinations - only because
some parts of its design were kept secret.
so they'll use a different technology to hide their illegal
activities. so will those law-abiding citizens, who do not trust their
government not to misuse its abilities to decrypt their conversations.
except from the government.
huh? later it says that the new technology will be export restricted.
in short, the new technology can:
1) protect the law abiding citizen's privacy from the casual snooper.
it cannot:
1) protect him from the government, if it decides to misuse its
ability to decrypt the conversations.
2) protect him from the criminals who succeed to break the new
encryption scheme or to steal the keys, or to bribe the people who
handle them, etc.
3) prevent the criminals from using secure encryption for
communication.
correct. however, it does not provide them that much privacy as it
claims.
two candidates: the nsa and the mafia.
that is, ""trust us"".
""security through obscurity"".
if it's not entirely open to public examination, it cannot be
trusted. besides, who can prove that the devices used for examination
and the ones built into your phones will be the same?
the nsa and the fbi?
why did they ""forget"" the academia?
doesn't this smell to monopolism?
like the mafia?
this is the main question, why was it buried at the end?
""we'll see"".
""trust us"".
in short, ""if we decide to outlaw strong crypto, we'll tell you"".
since the us government seems to consider strong crypto as munitions
and since the us constitutions guarantees the right to every american
to bear arms, why is not every american entitled, as a matter of
right, to an unbreakable commercial encryption product?
bullshit. the proposed technology provides a false sense of security,
encryption devices with built-in capabilities for breaking the
encryption, does not prevent the criminals to use strong crypto, and
is a step to outlaw strong crypto.
who was the optimist who believed that the new administration will
leave the export controls on strong crypto devices?
ok, i'm not american, it's not my business, but i just couldn't resist
to comment... the whole plot looks so totalitaristic... it's up to
you, americans, to fight for your rights.

15192.eml,sci.crypt,"the clear middle ground implied by these statements is to say that americans
have the right to clipper encryption, but not to unbreakable encryption.
this implies that, ultimately, non-clipper strong encryption must become
illegal.
(as an aside, isn't the language here jarring? all this talk about
""harmonious balance"" when they're talking about taking away people's
right to communications privacy?)
although the article emphasizes voice communication, data and mail encryption
is mentioned as well:
it looks like the worst nightmares raised by dorothy denning's proposals
are coming true. if the government continues on this course, i imagine
that we will see strong cryptography made illegal. encryption programs
for disk files and email, as well as software to allow for encrypted
voice communications, will be distributed only through the
""underground"". people will have to learn how to hide the fact that
they are protecting their privacy.
it's shocking and frightening to see that this is actually happening here.

initial eff analysis of clinton privacy and security proposal
the clinton administration today made a major announcement on
cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of
millions of americans. the first part of the plan is to begin a
comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as
export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to
robust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.
however, eff is very concerned that the administration has already
reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any
public comment or discussion has been allowed. apparently, the
administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone
equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the
national security agency. the so-called ""clipper chip"" is an 80-bit,
split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips
manufactured by a military contractor. two separate escrow agents would
store users' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon
presentation of a valid warrant. the encryption scheme used is to be
classified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for
incorporation into its communications products.
this proposal raises a number of serious concerns .
first, the administration has adopted a solution before conducting an
inquiry. the nsa-developed clipper chip may not be the most secure
product. other vendors or developers may have better schemes.
furthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for
the clipper or any other chips. rather, independent chip manufacturers
should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.
second, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. yet, the
administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified. eff
believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open. the
public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is
open to independent, expert scrutiny.
third, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may
prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement
needs, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is
adopted. what will give people confidence in the safety of their keys?
does disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual's fifth
amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries? these are but a few
of the many questions the administrations proposal raised but fails to
answer.
in sum, the administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance
of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy
and security. however, the ""clipper chip"" solution ought to be
considered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the
discussion even begins.
details of the proposal:
escrow
the 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom
hold 40-bits of each key. the manufacturer of the communications device
would be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow
agents. a key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.
upon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would
have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents. according to
the presidential directive just issued, the attorney general will be
asked to identify appropriate escrow agents. some in the administration
have suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the
federal reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen,
but there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.
classified algorithm and the possibility of back doors
the administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which
the government or others could break the code without securing keys from
the escrow agents -- and that the president will be told there are no
back doors to this classified algorithm. in order to prove this,
administration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto
cracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the
algorithm for trap doors. the results of the investigation would then be
made public.
the clipper chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source,
secret contract between the national security agency and two private
firms: vlsi and mycotronx. nsa work on this plan has been underway for
about four years. the manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.
government as market driver
in order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes
in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers
for this product. users will include the fbi, secret service, vp al
gore, and maybe even the president. at today's commerce department press
briefing, a number of people asked this question, though: why would any
private organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had
no independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors?
comprehensive policy inquiry
the administration has also announced that it is about to commence an
inquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection, encryption,
and law enforcement. the items to be considered include: export
controls on encryption technology and the fbi's digital telephony
proposal. it appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the
national security council. unfortunately, however, the presidential
directive describing the inquiry is classified. some public involvement
in the process has been promised, but they terms have yet to be specified.

fact sheet
public encryption management
the president has approved a directive on ""public encryption
management."" the directive provides for the following:
advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption
are part of a wave of new computer and communications technology.
encryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of
communications and data by preventing unauthorized access.
advanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to
rapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications.
these advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the
infrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the
information age.
despite its benefits, new communications technology can also
frustrate lawful government electronic surveillance. sophisticated
encryption can have this effect in the united states. when
exported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence
activities critical to our national interests. in the past, it has
been possible to preserve a government capability to conduct
electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law
enforcement and national security interests, while at the same time
protecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens. as
encryption technology improves, doing so will require new,
innovative approaches.
in the area of communications encryption, the u. s. government has
developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through
encryption that is substantially more robust than the current
government standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed
to unlock the encryption. the system for the escrowing of keys
will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information
only with appropriate legal authorization.
to assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect
and decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted
information, i hereby direct the following action to be taken:
installation of government-developed microcircuits
the attorney general of the united states, or her representative,
shall request manufacturers of communications hardware which
incorporates encryption to install the u.s. government-developed
key-escrow microcircuits in their products. the fact of law
enforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from
the american public. all appropriate steps shall be taken to
ensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow
microcircuit are made widely available to u.s. communications
hardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the
security of the key-escrow system. in making this decision, i do
not intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the
government from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that
are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-
escrow system.
key-escrow
the attorney general shall make all arrangements with appropriate
entities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits
installed in communications equipment. in each case, the key
holder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent
unauthorized release of the keys. the keys shall be released only
to government agencies that have established their authority to
acquire the content of those communications that have been
encrypted by devices containing the microcircuits. the attorney
general shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which
an agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such
communications.
procurement and use of encryption devices
the secretary of commerce, in consultation with other appropriate
u.s. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to
facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted
with key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems
that process sensitive but unclassified information. i expect this
process to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of
a final standard within six months of this directive.
the attorney general will procure and utilize encryption devices to
the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct
lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure
law enforcement communications. further, the attorney general
shall utilize funds from the department of justice asset forfeiture
super surplus fund to effect this purchase."

initial eff analysis of clinton privacy and security
proposal
the clinton administration today made a major announcement
on cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of
millions of americans. the first part of the plan is to begin a
comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues
such as export controls which have effectively denied most people
easy access to robust encryption as well as law enforcement issues
posed by new technology.
however, eff is very concerned that the administration has
already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before
any public comment or discussion has been allowed. apparently, the
administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone
equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed
by the national security agency. the so-called ""clipper chip"" is an
80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into
chips manufactured by a military contractor. two separate escrow
agents would store users' keys, and be required to turn them over
law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant. the
encryption scheme used is to be classified, but they chips will be
available to any manufacturer for incorporation into their
communications products.
this proposal raises a number of serious concerns .
first, the administration appears to be adopting a solution
before conducting an inquiry. the nsa-developed clipper chip may
not be the most secure product. other vendors or developers may
have better schemes. furthermore, we should not rely on the
government as the sole source for clipper or any other chips. rather,
independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets
based on open standards.
second, an algorithm can not be trusted unless it can be tested.
yet the administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm
classified. eff believes that any standard adopted ought to be public
and open. the public will only have confidence in the security of a
standard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.
third, while the use of the split-key, dual-escrowed
system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and
law enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored
publicly before it is adopted. what will give people confidence in the
safety of their keys? does disclosure of keys to a third party waive
individual's fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal
inquiries?
in sum, the administration has shown great sensitivity to the
importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into

15202.eml,sci.crypt,"note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap.
before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for
e-mail and files, let's focus on this.
one question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is
limited to telephony, or if the government intends to expand it.
though i share many of the concerns expressed by some, i find the proposal
less threatening than many others, since right now most americans have no
secure telephony, and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a ""goat"" can
eavesdrop. this would also plug up the security hole in cellular and
cordless phones.
reading between the lines, i infer that the system is highly secure
without access to the keys. this would meet the needs of u.s. businesses
confronted by rich and powerful adversaries, including french and japanese
security services and rich japanese companies. it allows the nsa to make
available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs.
most legitimate u.s. corporations trust the nsa, and would be delighted to
have a high-security system certified by them, even at the price of
depositing keys in escrow. i see no difficulty in creating a reliable
escrow. corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the
week, and that system has worked pretty well.
from my point of view this is a fair starting point. there are concerns that
need to be addressed, including the reliability of the escrows. but in
return we get access to high-security crypto. many have suggested that des
and other systems may be breakable by the nsa and hence others similarly
skilled and endowed. there is at least a good possibility (which should be
checked) that the proposed system is not so breakable. it doesn't have to
be, nor does it have to have trapdoors, if the government can get the keys
pursuant to a legitimate court order. thus they can protect legitimate
communications against economic adversaries, while still being able to
eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order.
in discussing this, let's try to avoid the nastiness, personal attacks and
noise of some previous threads. this is a substantive and technical issue,
and personal remarks have no place in such a discussion.
david sternlight great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of
our information, errors and omissions excepted."
15203.eml,sci.crypt,"presumably, the key split is so that no one group controls the privacy
of the key, and that it would be infeasible to illicitly gain access from
both agents.
however, if one agent wishes to break the crypto without the cooperation
of the other agent, a 40-bit key is not going to stand in the way of a
brute force attack. if an agency (for example, the nsa) were to hold one
of the two key-halves, then i don't imagine they really need the other half of
the key to start listening in.
or was that the point? (this is not to imply, at all, that i like the idea of the rest of the
system.)

facts a bit, shall we?
fact: it is unlawful to distribute code implementing rsa without a license

any use of rsa, other than for research purposes allowed under us patent
law, is similarly unlawful. therefore, the ""average citizen"" cannot use
rsa to encrypt message traffic in the us without a license from pkp.
there is no licensed, freely available product in the us that uses rsa
encryption other than rsaref (and hence ripem), at least as far as i am

i suppose it is a matter of opinion as to whether or not these terms count

15210.eml,sci.crypt,"i somehow started to doubt technical competence of the
people who designed the system. why on the earth split the
80-bit key in 40-bit parts to keep them in escrow separately
(having 40 bit and large volumes of data voice links produce
it should be relatively easy to break it) when they simply
could keep 80-bit sequences in n (n 2) independent places
and then xor all the partial keys to get the actual key (n-1
sequences should obviously be selected randomly and nth is the
actual key xor-ed with the random sequences).
(or is it a conspiracy? 1 2 :-)"
15211.eml,sci.crypt,"getting rid of the keys is actually pretty easy to do automatically on
a communications link, as opposed to storage where the keys have to be
retained somehow as long as the owner wants to be able to retrieve the
data.
the right way to do communications security is to generate a random
session key with diffie hellman, use it for a while and then destroy
it. once it's gone, there's no getting it back, and no way to decrypt
recordings of the conversation.
to make sure you aren't being attacked by a man in the middle, you
have to authenticate your dh exchanges. the at t secure phone does
this by displaying the dh key so you can compare them verbally over
the phone. this is nice and simple, but it relies on user awareness
plus the inability of the man in the middle to duplicate the users'
voices.
a better way is to authenticate the exchanges with rsa. since you'd
never use rsa for actual encryption, compromising your rsa secret key
would only allow someone to impersonate you in a future conversation,
and even that only until you revoke your public key. they would still
not be able to decrypt recordings of prior conversations for which the
session keys have been destroyed.

the presence of the clipper chip does change things, because it will

cellular company, or other phones or ports because they will follow
the standard. at t has already announced a clipper chip encryption
product. the government has marketed hard to get major vendors to
use these chips. if they get enough market share, they will rule.
and thus there will be very little market for systems that can't be
tapped by the police. the public isn't that concerned about it now,
after all. they freely do calls that anybody with an old tv can listen
to today! they won't pay big extra bucks for proprietary phones that secure
them only from the police.
well, some people will buy these phones, but they will only work with
other proprietary phones, so the market will be small and the phones
expensive. unless they are made in numbers large enough to sell them
cheap, only the mob will buy them.
and this means that the fbi will want to track the customer lists of
better encryption phones, because ""the only reason a person would want
one is to evade the police.""

15223.eml,sci.crypt,"i am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology
to restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures. the u.s.
government will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any
serious threat to my liberties such as this, and i call on everyone
with an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this
proposal. the administration does not seem to understand that they
are merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the
public, and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is
wholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty.
it seems to me that u.s. diplomatic communications should be
tappable by the u.n. whenever any countries produce a warrant to
the u.n. in fact, i think we should stop paying the nsa billions
of dollars a year to produce unbreakable codes for this reason.
these actions violate the sovereignity of international law. (i hope
mr. clinton is shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here.
but if he isn't, it's a modest and reasonable proposal, so he should
find merit with it nevertheless.)
cryptography is neutral technology. if everybody has strong
cryptography (including policemen, bureacrats, businessmen,
housewives, thugs and hoodlums), we have a sustainable
equilibrium. anything less is an unworkable anti-egaltarian
arrangement, intrinsically antithetical to american freedoms, and
guaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent
impracticality. we don't need to compromise on issues of freedom.
for too long our government has demonstrated itself to be
increasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality
and protecting americans.
it is not possible for the federal government
to act quickly'' or develop consistent, comprehensive
policies'' period. and even if by some grandiose miracle such
a thing were possible, it would only be an efficient way to
deprive american citizens of fundamental and inalienable rights.
the administration has to be committed to leaving private
industries alone, esp. on this issue. the government has no
legitimate role in regulating the content of communications.
law enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit their
surveillance bludgeon; they are soon and inevitably to be
disarmed of it.
no such laws can be constitutionally sound, and this is equivalent
to a veiled threat, which i don't appreciate. this kind of
extortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism. i will
trade threats for threats, and violation for violation.
if the administration did say this, it would find itself
impeached for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential,
established, entrenched, and explicit constitutional privacy
guarantees. the administration would have no legal standing
whatsoever; such an action would be egregiously illegal and
criminal, and wholly untolerated and disregarded by vast
segments of the population.
the u.s., comprised of a vast majority of people fanatically
committed to preserving their privacy in the face of an
increasingly totalitarian government, is saying just that.
take your chips and give them to nsa employees as christmas bonuses.
we can run any algorithm on our computers we damn well please,
and we will make any chips we please, and we will send any bit
pattern over our data highways we please. and if you try to stop
us, you will be gradually or abruptly dissolved into nothingness. privacy vs. law enforcement this is an outright dingaling denning lie. the two aims of
privacy and surveillance are intrinsically and fundamentally
incompatible, and you have to work for the nsa to think otherwise.
americans are about to discover ways, through the use of technology,
to preserve their inalienable but forgotten freedoms that have slowly
been eroded away by an increasingly distant and unresponsive and unrepresentative government."

at the end of the wiretap, they should be obligated to inform you that
a tap was performed, and replace (for free) the clipper chip in your
cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the
escrow houses.
do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are
laid? in many ways, it would be a positive step if they had to.
judges set time limits on warrants, i assume. at the end of the time

sensitive material, but it does seem to finally offer a reasonable way to
guard against casual eavesdropping. for example, even with my strong ""right
to bear arms"" view of the private right to possess and use strong
cryptosystems, the system as described provides enough security that i would
actually buy a cordless phone, and would be much less wary of using cellular
phones, walkie-talkies, and so on. as long as it's only used for mass-market
voice scrambling, i actually don't see a problem with it.
if you want more security than it offers, use something different. use pkcs

contents: in mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem? what is an attack? what's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically? why is the one-time pad secure? what's a ciphertext-only attack? what's a known-plaintext attack? what's a chosen-plaintext attack? in mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks? what's a key-guessing attack? what's entropy? in mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?
a private-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system e and a
decryption system d. the encryption system e is a collection of
functions e k, indexed by keys'' k, mapping some set of plaintexts'' p to some set of ciphertexts'' c. similarly the
decryption system d is a collection of functions d k such that
d k(e k(p)) p for every plaintext p. that is, succesful decryption
of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key
(index) as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext
into ciphertext. such systems, wherein the same key value is used to
encrypt and decrypt, are also known as symmetric'' cryptoystems. what is an attack?
in intuitive terms a (passive) attack on a cryptosystem is any method
of starting with some information about plaintexts and their
corresponding ciphertexts under some (unknown) key, and figuring out
more information about the plaintexts. it's possible to state
mathematically what this means. here we go.
fix functions f, g, and h of n variables. fix an encryption system e,
and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys.
an attack on e using g assuming f giving h with probability p is an
algorithm a with a pair f, g of inputs and one output h, such that
there is probability p of computing h h(p 1,...,p n), if we have
f f(p 1,...,p n) and g g(e k(p 1),...,e k(p n)). note that this
probability depends on the distribution of the vector (k,p 1,...,p n).
the attack is trivial (or pointless'') if there is probability at
least p of computing h h(p 1,...,p n) if f f(p 1,...,p n) and
g g(c 1,...,c n). here c 1,...,c n range uniformly over the possible
ciphertexts, and have no particular relation to p 1,...,p n. in other
words, an attack is trivial if it doesn't actually use the encryptions
e k(p 1),...,e k(p n).
an attack is called one-ciphertext'' if n 1, two-ciphertext'' if
n 2, and so on. what's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?
in basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure.
read part 3: we keep saying a strong cryptosystem must have this
property, but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem
is strong!''
in contrast, the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely
formulate and, if possible, prove the statement that a cryptosystem is
strong. we say, for example, that a cryptosystem is secure against
all (passive) attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system (as
defined above) is too slow to be practical. if we can prove this
statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist
any (passive) cryptanalytic technique. if we can reduce this statement
to some well-known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that
the cryptosystem isn't easy to break.
other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical
definition. again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions
we're making and prove that they produce the desired results. we can
figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used
properly: it just means that the assumptions are valid.
the same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too. the cryptanalyst
can take advantage of incorrect assumptions. often he can try to
construct a proof of security for a system, see where the proof fails,
and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis. why is the one-time pad secure?
by definition, the one-time pad is a cryptosystem where the
plaintexts, ciphertexts, and keys are all strings (say byte strings)
of some length m, and e k(p) is just the sum (let's say the exclusive
or) of k and p.
it is easy to prove mathematically that there are no nontrivial
single-ciphertext attacks on the one-time pad, assuming a uniform
distribution of keys. note that we don't have to assume a uniform
distribution of plaintexts. (here's the proof: let a be an attack,
i.e., an algorithm taking two inputs f, g and producing one output h,
with some probability p that h h(p) whenever f f(p) and
g g(e k(p)) (i.e., g g(k p)). then, because the distribution of
k is uniform and independent of p, the distribution of k p must also
be uniform and independent of p. but also the distribution of c is
uniform and independent of p. hence there is probability exactly p
that h h(p) whenever f f(p) and g g(c), over all p and c. thus
a fortiori a is trivial.)
on the other hand the one-time pad is not secure if a key k is used
for more than one plaintext: i.e., there are nontrivial
multiple-ciphertext attacks. so to be properly used a key k must be
thrown away after one encryption. the key is also called a pad'';
this explains the name one-time pad.'' what's a ciphertext-only attack?
in the notation above, a ciphertext-only attack is one where f is
constant. given only some information g(e k(p 1),...,e k(p n)) about
n ciphertexts, the attack has to have some chance of producing some
information h(p 1,...,p n) about the plaintexts. the attack is trivial
if it has just as good a chance of producing h(p 1,...,p n) when given
g(c 1,...,c n) for random c 1,...,c n.
for example, say g(c) c, and say h(p) is the first bit of p. we can
easily write down an attack---the guessing attack,'' which simply
guesses that h(p) is 1. this attack is trivial because it doesn't use
the ciphertext: it has a fifty-fifty chance of guessing correctly no
matter what. on the other hand there is an attack on rsa which
produces one bit of information about p, with 100 success, using c.
if it is fed a random c then the success rate drops to 50 . so this is
a nontrivial attack. what's a known-plaintext attack?
the classic known-plaintext attack has f(p 1,p 2) p 1,
g(c 1,c 2) (c 1,c 2), and h(p 1,p 2) depending only on p 2.
in other words, given two ciphertexts c 1 and c 2 and one decryption
p 1, the known-plaintext attack should produce information about the
other decryption p 2.
note that known-plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature
as producing information about the key, but this is pointless: the
cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him
decrypt further messages. what's a chosen-plaintext attack?
a chosen-plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical
series of active attacks on a cryptosystem: attacks where the
cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor. these attacks don't fit into
our model of passive attacks explained above. anyway, a
chosen-plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and
look at the corresponding ciphertext, then repeat until he has figured
out how to decrypt any message. more absurd examples of this sort of
attack are the chosen-key attack'' and chosen-system attack.''
a much more important form of active attack is a message corruption
attack, where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a
way as to make a useful change in the plaintext.
there are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks:
for instance, automatically encrypting any plaintext p as
t,e k(h(t r p),r,p), where t is a time-key (sequence number) chosen anew
for each message, r is a random number, and h is a one-way hash
function. here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive-or. in mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?
consider the following known-plaintext attack. we are given some
plaintexts p 1,...,p n-1 and ciphertexts c 1,...,c n-1 . we're
also given a ciphertext c n. we run through every key k. when we find
k such that e k(p i) c i for every i n, we print d k(c n).
if n is big enough that only one key works, this attack will succeed
on valid inputs all the time, while it will produce correct results
only once in a blue moon for random inputs. thus this is a nontrivial
attack. its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many
possible keys. what's a key-guessing attack? what's entropy?
say somebody is using the one-time pad---but isn't choosing keys
randomly and uniformly from all m-bit messages, as he was supposed to
for our security proof. in fact say he's known to prefer keys which
are english words. then a cryptanalyst can run through all english
words as possible keys. this attack will often succeed, and it's much
faster than a brute-force search of the entire keyspace.
we can measure how bad a key distribution is by calculating its
entropy. this number e is the number of real bits of information''
of the key: a cryptanalyst will typically happen across the key within
2 e guesses. e is defined as the sum of -p k log 2 p k, where p k is
the probability of key k."

wordperfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break.
the method uses xor with two repeating key streams: a typed password
and a byte-wide counter initialized to 1 . full
descriptions are given in bennett ben87 and bergen and caelli ber91 .
decrypt wordperfect document files and i think i have a solution.
there is a software company named: accessdata (87 east 600 south,
orem, ut 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will
decrypt any wordperfect, lotus 1-2-3, quatro-pro, ms excel and paradox
files. the cost of the package is 185. steep prices, but if you
think your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a
call and ask for the free demo disk. the demo disk will decrypt files
that have a 10 char or less pw key.'' how do i break a vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?
a repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the
plaintext xor keykeykeykey (and so on), is called a vigenere cipher.
if the key is not too long and the plaintext is in english, do the
following:
1. discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.
(see gaines gai44 , sinkov sin66 .) trying each displacement of
the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal.
if the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something
over 6 of the bytes will be equal. if they have used different
key, then less than 0.4 will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes
of key covering normal ascii text). the smallest displacement which
indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.
2. shift the text by that length and xor it with itself. this
removes the key and leaves you with text xored with itself. since
english has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of
text xored together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing
plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (and in fact
one stream of text xored with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)
if the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a
standard polyalphabetic substitution. all the old cryptanalysis
texts show how to break those. it's possible with those methods, in
the hands of an expert, if there's only ten times as much text as key.
see, for example, gaines gai44 , sinkov sin66 . how do i send encrypted mail under unix? pgp, ripem, pem, ... here's one popular method, using the des command:
cat file compress des private key uuencode mail
meanwhile, there is a de jure internet standard in the works called
pem (privacy enhanced mail). it is described in rfcs 1421 through
1424. to join the pem mailing list, contact there is a beta version of pem being tested at the time of this
writing.
there are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting
mail: pgp and ripem. both are available by ftp. each has its own
newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem. each has its own faq
as well.
pgp is most commonly used outside the usa since it uses the rsa algorithm
without a license and rsa's patent is valid only (or at least primarily)
in the usa.
ripem is most commonly used inside the usa since it uses the rsaref which
is freely available within the usa but not available for shipment outside
the usa.
since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of
the message (pgp used idea; ripem uses des) and rsa for encrypting the
message key, they should be able to interoperate freely. although there
have been repeated calls for each to understand the other's formats and
algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as
we know). is the unix crypt command secure?
no. see ree84 . there is a program available called cbw (crypt
breaker's workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks
on files encrypted with crypt. one source for cbw is ftpcb . how do i use compression with encryption?
a number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by
some simple encryption method (e.g., xor with a repeated key).
unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact
distribution of possible inputs. for all practical purposes it's
impossible to describe the typical english text'' beyond coarse
characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. you can build up
more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy
has a slightly more accurate model, he'll be able to find some
redundancy in your compressed output.
note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they
have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that
actually starts off with high redundancy. for example, the output of
unix compress begins with a well-known three-byte magic number''
that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.
this is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a
bad idea; it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means
removes the need for strong encryption.
compression after encryption is silly. is there an unbreakable cipher?
yes. the one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. unfortunately the
one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as
plaintext.
of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be
useful. rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by
likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is
expected to remain valid. what does random'' mean in cryptography?
cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom
number generator than most applications. for a source of bits to be
cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to
predict what the nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of
the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of
0th through n-1st bits, for all n up to the lifetime of the source.
a software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function
of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently
random bits. this seed must be large enough not to be guessed by
the opponent. ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps
generated by a hardware random number source).
those who have sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,
generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of
entropy, by not connecting anything to it. for example,
cat dev audio compress - foo
gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in
it). one can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,
for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random
string.
when looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is
important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that
because it looks complicated to a human, it must be ""random"". for
example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be
unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a
clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy. what is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?
see sha49 . the unicity distance is an approximation to that amount
of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in
the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number
of ciphertext bits used. ciphertexts significantly longer than this
can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. this is used to
back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis.
ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have
multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security
from the opponent's difficulty choosing the correct one.
unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic
measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives
probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext
for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible
plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys
are tried for the decryption. working cryptologists don't normally
deal with unicity distance as such. instead they directly determine
the likelihood of events of interest.
let the unicity distance of a cipher be d characters. if fewer than
d ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not
enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of
possible keys. des has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,
which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to
8 ascii characters). this may seem alarmingly low at first, but
the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work
required to find the key after approximately d characters have been
intercepted.
in fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used
in discussing unicity distance. (like other measures such as key
size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if
it's too small, but doesn't guarantee security if it's high.) few
practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all
manner of characteristics might serve as entering wedges'' to crack
some cipher messages. however, similar information-theoretic
considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a
recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.
cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and
information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most
promising directions.
unfortunately, most literature on the application of information
statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal
1940 work of alan turing (see koz84 ). for some insight into the
possibilities, see kul68 and goo83 . what is key management and why is it important?
one of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in
full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,
and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (of
course, one would assume that the cia does not make a habit of telling
mossad about its cryptosystems, but mossad probably finds out anyway.)
repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can
eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. thus, especially in
modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are
transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but
also enough key material to cover the traffic.
key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and
handling of keys.
a publicly accessible example of modern key management technology
is the stu iii secure telephone unit, which for classified use
employs individual coded crypto ignition keys'' and a central key
management center operated by nsa. there is a hierarchy in that
certain ciks are used by authorized cryptographic control
personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and
to perform installation maintenance functions, such as the
reporting of lost ciks.
this should give an inkling of the extent of the key management
problem. for public-key systems, there are several related issues,
many having to do with whom do you trust?'' can i use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?
chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from
relatively compact generators. perhaps the simplest example is a
linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random
number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds
and outputs. unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a
high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. mathematically
this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for
cryptanalysts to exploit. more complicated generators have more
complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---
but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable
structure at all.
see knu81 , exercise 3.5-7; ree77 ; and boy89 . what is the correct frequency list for english letters?
there are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than
the one before. you can find the first answer in various books:
namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of
english text. of course any such list will be correctly'' computed,
but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.
the second answer is that the question doesn't make sense. what do
you mean by english letters''? the english language'' is not a
fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. it
has changed over time; it is different between different authors.
any particular message will have different statistics from those of
the language as a whole.
the third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have
exactly the same characteristics as english in general, but for all
reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won't matter.
in fact there's an entire field called bayesian statistics'' (other
buzzwords are maximum entropy methods'' and maximum likelihood
estimation'') which studies questions like what's the chance that a
text with these letter frequencies is in english?'' and comes up with
reasonably robust answers.
so make your own list from your own samples of english text. it will
be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly. what is the enigma? for a project in data security we are looking for sources of
information about the german enigma code and how it was broken by
the british during wwii.''
see wel82 , dea85 , koz84 , hod83 , kah91 . how do i shuffle cards?
card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of
values, using a random or pseudo-random function. all possible output
permutations of this process should be equally likely. to do this, you
need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly
distributed random integer in the interval 0..x-1 . given that
function, you can shuffle with the following c code: (assuming arrlth
is the length of array arr and swap() interchanges values at the two
addresses given)
for ( n arrlth-1; n 0 ; n-- ) swap( arr modran( n 1 ) , arr n ) ;
modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() x) since
ranno()'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the
error will be very small. to cover this case, one can take ranno()'s
modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less
than y, go back and get another ranno() value. can i foil s w pirates by encrypting my cd-rom?
someone will frequently express the desire to publish a cd-rom with
possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted
separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps
even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.
as far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard
pc or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the
keyboard. if there were such an identification, then the cd-rom could be
encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in
part on the unique identifier. however, in this case the cd-rom is one
of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.
if the cd-rom is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must
be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in
the process. that key is useable with any copy of the cd-rom's data.
the pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the
illegal copy. can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers? (bruce schneier) says: accessdata of orem,
utah sells products that break the password scheme of a number of
popular macintosh and pc software packages. their telephone number
is (801) 224-6970

the story begins: when julius caesar sent messages to his trusted
acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. so he replaced every a
by a c, every b by a d, and so on through the alphabet. only someone
who knew the shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages.
a cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so
that only certain people can see through the disguise. cryptography is
the art of creating and using cryptosystems. cryptanalysis is the art
of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when
you're not supposed to be able to. cryptology is the study of both
cryptography and cryptanalysis.
the original message is called a plaintext. the disguised message is
called a ciphertext. encryption means any procedure to convert
plaintext into ciphertext. decryption means any procedure to convert
ciphertext into plaintext.
a cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. the
algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. for instance,
caesar probably used shift by n'' encryption for several different
values of n. it's natural to say that n is the key here.
the people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are
called recipients. other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,
eavesdroppers, or third parties. what references can i start with to learn cryptology?
for an introduction to technical matter, the survey articles given
in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are, in general,
concise, authored by competent people, and well written. however,
these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has
developed in the last 50 years or so, and are more abstract and
mathematical than historical. the codebreakers by kahn kah67 is
encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up
to the mid-60's.
introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from gaines gai44 or
sinkov sin66 . this is recommended especially for people who want
to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common
mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one.
the selection of an algorithm for the des drew the attention of
many public researchers to problems in cryptology. consequently
several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. the
book of denning den82 gives a good introduction to a broad range
of security including encryption algorithms, database security,
access control, and formal models of security. similar comments
apply to the books of price davies pri84 and pfleeger pfl89 .
the books of konheim kon81 and meyer matyas mey82 are quite
technical books. both konheim and meyer were directly involved in
the development of des, and both books give a thorough analysis of
des. konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses
of many classical cryptosystems. meyer and matyas concentrate on
modern cryptographic methods, especially pertaining to key management
and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and
networks.
the books of rueppel rue86 and koblitz kob89 concentrate on
the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography. how does one go about cryptanalysis?
classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of
analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools, pattern
finding, patience, determination, and luck. the best available
textbooks on the subject are the military cryptanalytics series frie1 . it is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is, for
the most part, gained through the attempted solution of given
systems. such experience is considered so valuable that some of the
cryptanalyses performed during wwii by the allies are still
classified.
modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer,
or taking a discrete logarithm. these are not the traditional fare
of the cryptanalyst. computational number theorists are some of the
most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems. what is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?
in a nutshell: if f(x) y and you know y and can compute f, you can
find x by trying every possible x. that's brute-force search.
example: say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding
ciphertext, but doesn't know the key. he can simply try encrypting the
plaintext using each possible key, until the ciphertext matches---or
decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext, whichever is faster.
every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this
brute-force search is impractical.
advances in technology sometimes change what is considered
practical. for example, des, which has been in use for over 10 years
now, has 2 56, or about 10 17, possible keys. a computation with
this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the
mid-70's. the situation is very different today given the dramatic
decrease in cost per processor operation. massively parallel
machines threaten the security of des against brute force search.
some scenarios are described by garron and outerbridge gar91 .
one phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a
brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities. what are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?
the security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key
rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret.
a strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above. the
unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of
ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and
if for some key, the unicity distance is much longer than the amount
of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key, the system is
probably strong.
a strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears
random to all standard statistical tests (see, for example, cae90 ).
a strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. a
system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect.
if a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily
strong? certainly not. many weak cryptosystems looked good at first.
however, sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is
strong by mathematical proof. if joe can break this system, then
he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring
integers.'' see part 6. failing that, it's a crap shoot. if a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it
guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?
cryptanalytic methods include what is known as practical
cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your
ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. for instance, he might
assume cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. if the crib is
correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the
rest of the message. or he might exploit isologs''---the same
plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. thus
he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he
doesn't have a chance.
sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused. the one-time pad,
for example, loses all security if it is used more than once! even
chosen-plaintext attacks, where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into
the encryptor until he can deduce the key, have been employed. see kah67 . why are many people still using cryptosystems that are
relatively easy to break?
some don't know any better. often amateurs think they can design
secure systems, and are not aware of what an expert cryptanalyst
could do. and sometimes there is insufficient motivation for anybody
to invest the work needed to crack a system."

read news.announce.newusers and news.answers for a few weeks. always
make sure to read a newsgroup for some time before you post to it.
you'll be amazed how often the same question can be asked in the same
newsgroup. after a month you'll have a much better sense of what the
readers want to see. do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?
no. in fact some newsgroups (notably misc.legal.computing) were
created exactly so that political questions like should rsa be
patented?'' don't get in the way of technical discussions. many
sci.crypt readers also read misc.legal.computing, comp.org.eff.talk,
comp.patents, sci.math, comp.compression, et al.; for the benefit of
people who don't care about those other topics, try to put your
postings in the right group.
questions about microfilm and smuggling and other non-cryptographic spy stuff'' don't belong in sci.crypt either. how do i present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt? i just came up with this neat method of encryption. here's some
ciphertext: is it strong?'' without a
doubt questions like this are the most annoying traffic on sci.crypt.
if you have come up with an encryption scheme, providing some
ciphertext from it is not adequate. nobody has ever been impressed by
random gibberish. any new algorithm should be secure even if the
opponent knows the full algorithm (including how any message key is
distributed) and only the private key is kept secret. there are some
systematic and unsystematic ways to take reasonably long ciphertexts
and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm, but
this is a time-consuming and possibly fruitless exercise which most
sci.crypt readers won't bother with.
so what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme? first of all,
find out if it's really new. look through this faq for references and
related methods. familiarize yourself with the literature and the
introductory textbooks.
when you can appreciate how your cryptosystem fits into the world at
large, try to break it yourself! you shouldn't waste the time of tens
of thousands of readers asking a question which you could have easily
answered on your own.
if you really think your system is secure, and you want to get some
reassurance from experts, you might try posting full details of your
system, including working code and a solid theoretical explanation, to
sci.crypt. (keep in mind that the export of cryptography is regulated
in some areas.)
if you're lucky an expert might take some interest in what you posted.
you can encourage this by offering cash rewards---for instance, noted
cryptographer ralph merkle is offering 1000 to anyone who can break
snefru-4---but there are no guarantees. if you don't have enough
experience, then most likely any experts who look at your system will
be able to find a flaw. if this happens, it's your responsibility to
consider the flaw and learn from it, rather than just add one more
layer of complication and come back for another round.
a different way to get your cryptosystem reviewed is to have the nsa
look at it. a full discussion of this procedure is outside the scope
of this faq.
among professionals, a common rule of thumb is that if you want to
design a cryptosystem, you have to have experience as a cryptanalyst."

contents: what is a product cipher? what makes a product cipher secure? what are some group-theoretic properties of product ciphers? what can be proven about the security of a product cipher? how are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size? can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication? what exactly is des? what is triple des? what is differential cryptanalysis? how was nsa involved in the design of des? is des available in software? is des available in hardware? can des be used to protect classified information? what are ""ecb"", ""cbc"", ""cfb"", and ""ofb"" encryption? what is a product cipher?
a product cipher is a block cipher that iterates several weak
operations such as substitution, transposition, modular
addition multiplication, and linear transformation. (a block
cipher'' just means a cipher that encrypts a block of data---8 bytes,
say---all at once, then goes on to the next block.) the notion of
product ciphers is due to shannon sha49 . examples of modern
product ciphers include lucifer sor84 , des nbs77 , sp-networks kam78 , loki bro90 , feal shi84 , pes lai90 , khufu and khafre me91a . the so-called feistel ciphers are a class of product
ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round,
and then swap the ciphertext halves after each round. lucifer,
des, loki, and feal are examples of feistel ciphers.
the following table compares the main parameters of several product
ciphers:
cipher block length key bits number of rounds
lucifer 128 128 16
des 64 56 16
loki 64 64 16
feal 64 128 2 x, x 5
pes 64 128 8 what makes a product cipher secure?
nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is
completely secure. so in practice one begins by demonstrating that the
cipher looks highly random''. for example, the cipher must be
nonlinear, and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends
on every bit of the plaintext and the key. meyer mey78 has shown
that at least 5 rounds of des are required to guarantee such a
dependence. in this sense a product cipher should act as a mixing''
function which combines the plaintext, key, and ciphertext in a
complex nonlinear fashion.
the fixed per-round substitutions of the product cipher are
referred to as s-boxes. for example, lucifer has 2 s-boxes, and des
has 8 s-boxes. the nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a
careful design of these s-boxes. a list of partial design criteria
for the s-boxes of des, which apply to s-boxes in general, may be
found in brown bro89 and brickell et al. bri86 . what are some group-theoretic properties of product ciphers?
let e be a product cipher that maps n-bit blocks to n-bit blocks.
let e k(x) be the encryption of x under key k. then, for any fixed k,
the map sending x to e k(x) is a permutation of the set of n-bit
blocks. denote this permutation by p k. the set of all n-bit
permutations is called the symmetric group and is written s 2 n .
the collection of all these permutations p k, where k ranges over all
possible keys, is denoted e(s 2 n ). if e were a random mapping from
plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect e(s 2 n ) to generate
a large subset of s 2 n .
coppersmith and grossman cop74 have shown that a very simple
product cipher can generate the alternating group a 2 n given a
sufficient number of rounds. (the alternating group is half of the
symmetric group: it consists of all even'' permutations, i.e., all
permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps.)
even and goldreich eve83 were able to extend these results to show
that feistel ciphers can generate a 2 n , given a sufficient number
of rounds.
the security of multiple encipherment also depends on the
group-theoretic properties of a cipher. multiple encipherment is an
extension over single encipherment if for keys k1, k2 there does
not exist a third key k3 such that
e k2(e k1(x)) e (k3)(x) ( )
which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys
k1, k2 is equal to a single encryption under the third key k3. if
for every k1, k2 there exists a k3 such that eq. ( ) is true then
we say that e is a group.
this question of whether des is a group under this definition was
extensively studied by sherman, kaliski, and rivest she88 . in their
paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that des is not a
group. in fact des is not a group cam93 . what can be proven about the security of a product cipher?
recall from above that p k is a permutation produced by e under
some key k. the goal of the designer of e is to ensure that p k
appears to be a random element of s 2 n , the symmetric group.
let r be an element of s 2 n selected randomly. we will say that p k
and r are indistinguishable if an observer given p k and r in some
order cannot distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial
time. that is, with time bounded resources, the observer cannot
determine which of the permutations is produced by e: the optimal
decision is no better than simply guessing.
luby and rackoff lub88 have shown that a class of feistel ciphers
are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by
random boolean functions. how are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size?
there are four standard ""modes of operation"" (and numerous non-standard
ones as well). the standard modes of operation are defined in the u.s.
department of commerce federal information processing standard (fips) 81,
published in 1980. see the question about ""ecb"" below for more details.
although they are defined for the des block cipher, the ""modes of
operation"" can be used with any block cipher. can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication?
one may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself
that he did or did not generate a message, and to prove to himself
whether his message was altered or unaltered since generation. but one
cannot prove these things to another without revealing the key, and
thereafter that key cannot be used to prove anything about any messages
that were authenticated using that key.
see ansi x3.106-1983 and fips 113 (1985) for a standard method of message
authentication using des. what exactly is des?
des is the u.s. government's data encryption standard - a product
cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks of data, using a 56-bit key.
it is defined in fips 46-1 (1988) which supersedes fips 46 (1977) .
fips are federal information processing standards published by ntis.
des is identical to the ansi standard data encryption algorithm (dea)
defined in ansi x3.92-1981. what is triple des?
triple des is a product cipher which, like des, operates on 64-bit
data blocks. there are several forms, each of which uses the des
cipher 3 times. some forms use two 56-bit keys, some use three.
the ""des modes of operation"" may also be used with triple-des.
some people refer to e(k1,d(k2,e(k1,x))) as triple-des.
this method is defined in chapter 7.2 of the ansi standard x9.17-1985
""financial institution key management"" and is intended for use in
encrypting des keys and ivs for ""automated key distribution"". its
formal name is ""encryption and decryption of a single key by a key
pair"", but it is referenced in other standards documents as ede.
that standard says (section 7.2.1): ""key encrypting keys may be a single
dea key or a dea key pair. key pairs shoud be used where additional
security is needed (e.g., the data protected by the key(s) has a long
security life). a key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a
single key.""
others use the term ""triple-des"" for e(k1,d(k2,e(k3,x))) or
e(k1,e(k2,e(k3,x))).
one of us (carl ellison) keeps advocating des triple use in the form
e(k1, tran( e(k2, tran( e(k3, compress( x )))))), where each des instance
has its own key and iv (for cbc mode) and tran has been posted on
sci.crypt. (it is a large-block transposition program taking its key
from the data stream itself, so that it is not an encryption program on
its own part.) what is differential cryptanalysis?
differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be
applied to any iterated mapping (ie. any mapping which is based on
a repeated round function). the method was recently popularized by
biham and shamir bih91 , but coppersmith has remarked that the
s-boxes of des were optimized against this attack some 20 years ago.
this method has proved effective against several product ciphers,
notably feal bi91a .
differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of
ciphertexts y, y' whose corresponding plaintexts x, x' satisfy a
known difference d x x', where is componentwise xor. in the
basic biham-shamir attack, 2 47 such plaintext pairs are required
to determine the key for des. substantially fewer pairs are required
if des is truncated to 6 or 8 rounds. in these cases, the actual key
can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs.
for full des this attack is impractical because it requires so many
known plaintexts.
the work of biham and shamir on des revealed several startling
observations on the algorithm. most importantly, if the key
schedule was removed from des and a 16 48 768-bit key was used,
the key could be recovered in less than 2 64 steps. thus
independent subkeys do not add substantial security to des.
further, the s-boxes of des are extremely sensitive in that
changing even single entries in these tables yields significant
improvement in the differential attack.
adi shamir is quoted to say (nytimes oct 13 1991), i would say
that, contrary to what some people believe, there is no evidence
of tampering with the des so that the basic design was weakened.'' how was nsa involved in the design of des?
according to kinnucan kin78 , tuchman, a member of the group that
developed des at ibm is quoted as saying, we developed the des
algorithm entirely within ibm using ibmers. the nsa did not
dictate a single wire!'' tuchman and meyer (another developer of
des) spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in
lucifer. they then spent two years strengthening lucifer. their
basic approach was to look for strong substitution, permutation,
and key scheduling functions ... ibm has classified the notes
containing the selection criteria at the request of the nsa.... the nsa told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep
secrets it uses to make its own algorithms,' explains tuchman.''
on the other hand, a document called involvement of the nsa in
the development of des: unclassified summary of the united states
select committee on intelligence'', printed in the ieee
communications magazine, p53-55, 1978, states: in the development
of des, nsa convinced ibm that a reduced keysize was sufficient;
indirectly assisted in the development of the s-box structures; and
certified that the final des algorithm was, to the best of their
knowledge, free from any statistical or mathematical weakness.''
clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the nsa.
the article further states that the nsa did not tamper with the
algorithm itself, just the parameters, which in some sense
resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of meyer and tuchman
presented above. is des available in software?
several people have made des code available via ftp (see part 10 for
pathnames): stig ostholm ftpso ; bsd ftpbk ; eric young ftpey ;
dennis furguson ftpdf ; mark riordan ftpmr ; phil karn ftppk .
a pascal listing of des is also given in patterson pat87 .
fips 46-1 says ""the algorithm specified in this standard is to be
implemented ... using hardware (not software) technology. ...
software implementations in general purpose computers are not in
compliance with this standard."" despite this, software
implementations abound, and are used by government agencies. is des available in hardware?

contents: what is public-key cryptography? what's rsa? is rsa secure? how fast can people factor numbers? what about other public-key cryptosystems? what is public-key cryptography?
in a classic cryptosystem, we have encryption functions e k and
decryption functions d k such that d k(e k(p)) p for any plaintext
p. in a public-key cryptosystem, e k can be easily computed from some public key'' x which in turn is computed from k. x is published, so
that anyone can encrypt messages. if d k cannot be easily computed
from x, then only the person who generated k can decrypt messages.
that's the essence of public-key cryptography, published by diffie
and hellman in 1976.
in a classic cryptosystem, if you want your friends to be able to
send secret messages to you, you have to make sure nobody other than
them sees the key k. in a public-key cryptosystem, you just publish x,
and you don't have to worry about spies.
this is only the beginning of public-key cryptography. there is an
extensive literature on security models for public-key cryptography,
applications of public-key cryptography, other applications of the
mathematical technology behind public-key cryptography, and so on. what's rsa?
rsa is a public-key cryptosystem defined by rivest, shamir, and
adleman. for full details, there is a faq available by ftp at
rsa.com. here's a small example.
plaintexts are positive integers up to 2 512 . keys are quadruples
(p,q,e,d), with p a 256-bit prime number, q a 258-bit prime number,
and d and e large numbers with (de - 1) divisible by (p-1)(q-1). we
define e k(p) p e mod pq, d k(c) c d mod pq.
now e k is easily computed from the pair (pq,e)---but, as far as
anyone knows, there is no easy way to compute d k from the pair
(pq,e). so whoever generates k can publish (pq,e). anyone can send a
secret message to him; he is the only one who can read the messages. is rsa secure?
nobody knows. an obvious attack on rsa is to factor pq into p and q.
see below for comments on how fast state-of-the-art factorization
algorithms run. unfortunately nobody has the slightest idea how to
prove that factorization---or any realistic problem at all, for that
matter---is inherently slow. it is easy to formalize what we mean by rsa is isn't strong''; but, as hendrik w. lenstra, jr., says, exact definitions appear to be necessary only when one wishes to
prove that algorithms with certain properties do not exist, and
theoretical computer science is notoriously lacking in such negative
results.'' how fast can people factor numbers?
it depends on the size of the numbers. in october 1992 arjen lenstra
and dan bernstein factored 2 523 - 1 into primes, using about three
weeks of maspar time. (the maspar is a 16384-processor simd machine;
each processor can add about 200000 integers per second.) the
algorithm there is called the number field sieve''; it is quite a
bit faster for special numbers like 2 523 - 1 than for general numbers
n, but it takes time only about exp(o(log 1 3 n log 2 3 log n)) in
any case.
an older and more popular method for smaller numbers is the multiple
polynomial quadratic sieve'', which takes time exp(o(log 1 2 n
log 1 2 log n))---faster than the number field sieve for small n,
but slower for large n. the breakeven point is somewhere between 100
and 150 digits, depending on the implementations.
factorization is a fast-moving field---the state of the art just a few
years ago was nowhere near as good as it is now. if no new methods are
developed, then 2048-bit rsa keys will always be safe from
factorization, but one can't predict the future. (before the number
field sieve was found, many people conjectured that the quadratic
sieve was asymptotically as fast as any factoring method could be.) what about other public-key cryptosystems?
we've talked about rsa because it's well known and easy to describe.
but there are lots of other public-key systems around, many of which
are faster than rsa or depend on problems more widely believed to be
difficult. this has been just a brief introduction; if you really want
to learn about the many facets of public-key cryptography, consult the
books and journal articles listed in part 10."

contents: what is a one-way hash function? what is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.? what are md4 and md5? what is snefru? what is a one-way hash function?
a typical one-way hash function takes a variable-length message and
produces a fixed-length hash. given the hash it is computationally
impossible to find a message with that hash; in fact one can't
determine any usable information about a message with that hash, not
even a single bit. for some one-way hash functions it's also
computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the
same hash.
a one-way hash function can be private or public, just like an
encryption function. here's one application of a public one-way hash
function, like md5 or snefru. most public-key signature systems are
relatively slow. to sign a long message may take longer than the user
is willing to wait. solution: compute the one-way hash of the message,
and sign the hash, which is short. now anyone who wants to verify the
signature can do the same thing.
another name for one-way hash function is message digest function. what is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?
there is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a
very small set of concepts. when an algorithm depends on a key which
isn't published, we call it a private algorithm; otherwise we call it
a public algorithm. we have encryption functions e and decryption
functions d, so that d(e(m)) m for any message m. we also have
hashing functions h and verification functions v, such that v(m,x) 1
if and only if x h(m).
a public-key cryptosystem has public encryption and private
decryption. checksums, such as the application mentioned in the
previous question, have public hashing and public verification.
digital signature functions have private hashing and public
verification: only one person can produce the hash for a message,
but everyone can verify that the hash is correct.
obviously, when an algorithm depends on a private key, it's meant to
be unusable by anyone who doesn't have the key. there's no real
difference between a shared'' key and a private key: a shared key
isn't published, so it's private. if you encrypt data for a friend
rather than for your eyes only'', are you suddenly doing shared-key encryption'' rather than private-key encryption? no. what are md4 and md5?
md4 and md5 are message digest functions developed by ron rivest.
definitions appear in rfc 1320 and rfc 1321 (see part 10). code is
available from ftpmd .
note that a transcription error was found in the original md5 draft
rfc. the corrected algorithm should be called md5a, though some
people refer to it as md5. what is snefru?
snefru is a family of message digest functions developed by ralph
merkle. snefru-8 is an 8-round function, the newest in the family.
definitions appear in merkle's paper me91a . code is available from ftpsf ."

contents: what is the national security agency (nsa)? what are the us export regulations? what is tempest? what are the beale ciphers, and are they a hoax? what is the american cryptogram association, and how do i get in touch? is rsa patented? what about the voynich manuscript? what is the national security agency (nsa)?
the nsa is the official security body of the u.s. government. it
was given its charter by president truman in the late 40's, and
has continued research in cryptology till the present. the nsa is
known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,
and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the
world. governments in general have always been prime employers of
cryptologists. the nsa probably possesses cryptographic expertise many
years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break
many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national
security almost all information about the nsa is classified.
bamford's book bamfd gives a history of the people and operations of
the nsa. the following quote from massey mas88 highlights the
difference between public and private research in cryptography: ... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,
one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted
behind closed doors. without doubt, the number of workers engaged
today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of
those engaged in open research in cryptology. for only about 10
years has there in fact been widespread open research in
cryptology. there have been, and will continue to be, conflicts
between these two research communities. open research is common
quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open
exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in
scholarly journals. but can a government agency, charged with
responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,
countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? can
a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might
undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers?
one might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would
force all governments to behave like stimson's gentlemen', but one
must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with
political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most
scientific fields. the wonder is not that some conflicts have
occurred between government agencies and open researchers in
cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which
we are aware) have been so few and so mild.'' what are the us export regulations?
in a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control
export of encryption software. one is the bureau of export
administration (bxa) in the department of commerce, authorized by
the export administration regulations (ear). another is the office
of defense trade controls (dtc) in the state department, authorized
by the international traffic in arms regulations (itar). as a rule
of thumb, bxa (which works with cocom) has less stringent
requirements, but dtc (which takes orders from nsa) wants to see
everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to bxa.
the newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting
discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what
people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which
go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. make sure to
consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in
jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at
least heard of the itar. what is tempest?
tempest is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer
equipment. it was created in response to the discovery that
information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a crt) at
quite a distance and with little effort.
needless to say, encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext
is available this way. what are the beale ciphers, and are they a hoax?
(thanks to jim gillogly for this information and john king for
corrections.)
the story in a pamphlet by j. b. ward (1885) goes: thomas
jefferson beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass
of treasure and buried it in bedford county, virginia, leaving
three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the
location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.
ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called b2;
it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the
declaration of independence (doi) as key. b1 and b3 are unsolved;
many documents have been tried as the key to b1.
aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve b1 by various
means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:
the beale cypher association
p.o. box 975
beaver falls, pa 15010
you can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles faql by including the
line:
send index
in a message to and following the directions.
(there are apparently several different versions of the cipher
floating around. the correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,
says john king some believe the story is a hoax. kruh kru88 gives a long list of
problems with the story. gillogly gil80 decrypted b1 with the doi
and found some unexpected strings, including abfdefghiijklmmnohpp.
hammer (president of the beale cypher association) agrees that this
string couldn't appear by chance, but feels there must be an
explanation; gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this
string. what is the american cryptogram association, and how do i get in touch?
the aca is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis
on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with
pencil-and-paper or computers. its organ the cryptogram'' includes
articles and challenge ciphers. among the more than 50 cipher types in
english and other languages are simple substitution, playfair,
vigenere, bifid, bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.
dues are 15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of north america;
less for students under 18 and seniors. subscriptions should be sent
to aca treasurer, 18789 west hickory st., mundelein, il 60060. is rsa patented?
yes. the patent number is 4,405,829, filed 12 14 77, granted 9 20 83.
for further discussion of this patent, whether it should have been
granted, algorithm patents in general, and related legal and moral
issues, see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. for information
about the league for programming freedom see ftppf . note that one of
the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as should rsa be patented?'', which often flooded sci.crypt and other
technical newsgroups, into a more appropriate forum. what about the voynich manuscript? (nelson minar) says there is a mailing list on the
subject. the address to write to subscribe to the vms mailing list
is: the ftp archive is: rand.org: pub voynich
there's all sorts of information about the manuscript itself, of
course. a good bibliography can be found on the ftp site. kahn's
""the codebreakers"" gives a good introduction."

the net, and if the net should be sitting so idle that it can't get 10k

once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access. the
telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant. that's the rule
today.
but even so, the evidence would not be admissible, i think, unless the

cellular calls and then ask a judge, ""hey, can we have permission to

yes, that is a major concern, but i think that they think they can

public encryption management
the first thing it doesn't say is ""we're giving you stronger encryption"".
what it says is
the u. s. government has developed a microcircuit that not only
provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust
than the current government standard, but also permits escrowing of
the keys needed to unlock the encryption. the system for the
escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to
encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization.
but des is strong enough that only the government can break it now,
so the major effect is to make it easier for government to break! at best it makes it more difficult for the nsa to break, since they
need to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute-force search
for the other 40-bit key.
similarly, it didn't say ""we're making encryption is commercially available.""
because encryption is already commercially available, including
forms the nsa may not be able to break, like triple-des or idea.
and phone companies could offer des-based systems now if they were
convinced the government would let them and they could make enough money.
the next thing it didn't say is ""we're making encryption legal"",
because of course encryption has always been legal, and the
president can't change the first amendment merely by decree.
what it did say was:
in making this decision, i do not intend to prevent the
private sector from developing, or the government from approving,
other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in
assuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system.
which clearly means ""we're making encryption illegal unless we get your keys.
soon. once business buys into this.""
another thing it didn't say is ""we're going to ask congress for money
to do lots more wiretapping"", because of course, there's a budget crisis,
and congress might debate the policy issues or not give them the cash.
what it did say was:
the attorney general will procure and utilize encryption devices to
the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct
lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure
law enforcement communications. further, the attorney general
shall utilize funds from the department of justice asset forfeiture
super surplus fund to effect this purchase.
which means ""we've got money congress can't control and we're going to
buy lots of wiretapping equipment with it to detect non-approved crypto

means.) pray for peace; bill bill stewart 1-908-949-0705 at t bell labs 4m312 holmdel nj no, i'm from new jersey, i only work in cyberspace.... white house commect line 1-202-456-1111 fax 1-202-456-2461"

15281.eml,sci.crypt,"""agrep 2.0.4"" -- a fast approximate pattern-matching tool
source code project available from:
cs.arizona.edu
in directory ""agrep""
agrep is a very fast fuzzy search tool with a tremendous
number of powerful search options. the one most obviously
applicable to cryptography (key selection) is to be able to
specify the ""similarity"" of matches in the data.
for example say you make up a password phrase of ""qimwe7l"".
of course you rightly suspect that this key itself is not
in any dictionary or word list. but how close is it to
en entry that could be varied by some ""crack"" program to
brute-force search for it?
you use agrep to find out. looking with argument for none,
one or two errors, no matches. good so far. but
agrep -3 ""qimwe7l"" bigwordandphraselist
finds that the pattern ""qimwe7l"" is too close to the
pattern ""imsel"" (part of ""himself"" and a host of others),
to be of any cryptographic value as a key.
an error of level two corresponds to a simple transposition of
letters like ""teh"" for ""the"". a minimally acceptable password
would have to pass as least level 3 in order not immediately
ruled-out as even a remote possibility of being a good password.
(in real cryptographic use, my personal passphrases clear at least level 8 on my rather large 80 meg word and phrase lists.)
and for searching for key words in human-typed data (lots o'
typos) the tool is unexcelled. for example, for example,
say i want to find out what people think about gibson's
sf book ""neuromancer"" in the huge sf-lover's archives.
even with an error distance specification as small as
of ""1"" i will find all those people who think the title
was ""necromancer"" or other common typos. why miss anything?
also, the program can look for up to 30,000 patterns in parallel
at boyer-moore (sublinear) speeds. great for a nsa wannabe
to look for your name, terrorists names, special tagalog or
religious words, etc. in the news or e-mail spool directories.
you can even search for ciphertext by using, say, 30,000
random three-byte combinations and eliminate all texts that
don't score the x chi-square 'birthday' hits on message size y.
you think some crypto-terrorist is try to foil you by changing
the pattern on you? no problem. try agrep -p nsa to find
nsa, national security agency, nsecag, no such agency,
national scrabble association, n s a, etc.
you can also specify ""fixed"" areas: looking for license
plate xyz123 when you know that the letters are correct,
you might say:
agrep -2 123 licenseplatedatabase
will find all plates starting with xyz with up to two errors
(addition, substitution, deletion) in the number area. you can
also ""weight"" the relative ""cost"" for substiutions, additions,
or deletion errors. for example, when searching dna patterns
for a particular protein combination, you might know that
some kinds of damage cause the ""a"" nucelotide to drop out more
than other errors... you could adjust for this bias by setting
-dc where you set the ""deletion cost"" to count as ""c"" errors.
a steganographic use (i even used ""agrep -2 "" eograp"" e""
just now to find the correct spelling!) would be to intentionally
introduce errors of a certain type and magnitude into a plaintext
and then later recover the orginal it via an agrep pipe. lots of
possibilities here when only outlaws can have ciphertext...
also with agrep's powerful extraction options it makes it easy
to abstract the ""hits"" into a useful form. for example,
agrep -d "" from"" 'pgp;(passphrase zimmerman nsa)'
says output the entire mail record, delimited by 'from'
that contains 'pgp' and contains either 'passphrase',
'zimmerman', or 'nsa'.
and agrep has been measured an order-of-magnitude faster
than the second-best similarity tool publicly available.
as usual, i will be glad to e-mail the source and docs
to those who reqest them by e-mail if they cannot do
an anonymous ftp.
get this now.
it is too powerful to stay in the hands of the nsa.

15283.eml,sci.crypt,"yes it is. from the national film board of canada.
guy"
15284.eml,sci.crypt,"i'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan, hence my
followup to sci.crypt. frankly, if you're not an absolutist, your
feelings may turn on some of these issues. for example -- with an
80-bit key, simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less
acceptable than other schemes, because it means that if just one
repository is, shall we say, overly pliable, a would-be eavesdropper
would need to recover just 40 more bits of key. i need not point out
in this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search.
a slightly more complex scheme -- xor-ing the key with a random number,
and then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys,
neither of which is useful alone. that variant is much more resistant
to attack. clearly, one can get even more sophisticated, to protect
the subkeys even more.
other thoughts... some people have noted the size and complexity of
the databases necessary. but the id strings the phones emit could be
their back door key, double-encrypted with the escrow repositories'
public keys. for that matter, they could do that only with session
keys, and have no back door at all. in that case, the fbi would have
to bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted. this
would answer many of the objections along the lines of how do you
make sure they stop''.
we can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back
door -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record
of the time, phone number, etc, of the call. that provides proof to
the escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of
the warrant.
i can suggest other variations, too. suppose each clipper chip had 100
public key pairs. each would be used 10 times, after which you'd need
more keying material. (not a bad idea in any event.) this could be
used to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant;
the keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very
long.
i suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure. apart from
the obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the
back door? -- i think that the government is still genuinely concerned
about foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets. this
scheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it, too. (i've heard
rumors, over the years, that some factions within nsa were unhappy with
des because it was too good. not that they couldn't crack it, but it
was much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.) they're keeping
the details secret so that others don't build their own implementations
without the back door.
the cryptographic protocol, though, is another matter. i see no valid
reasons for keeping it secret, and -- as i hope i've shown above -- there
are a lot of ways to do things that aren't (quite) as bad."
15285.eml,sci.crypt,"the fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things:
1. the nsa has been working on this for a long time, and it only just
now happened to be ready'' to release to the world at this time.
2. the nsa has been working on this for a long time, but wasn't able
to get the bush administration to go along with this plan. (i
find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy
for the unescrowed use of cryptography; more likely the
administration felt that even escrowed, secret-algorithm and, for
all we know, trivially breakable cryptography should not be made
widely available.)
thus said (clipper chip announcement):
the majority of the discussion involving this ""clipper chip"" seems to
pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations. does anyone
know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog
signals? the language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.
the main thing i just don't get is whether this chip implements
symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques. anybody know?
i'm guessing symmetric, but they don't get very clear about it. if it
is symmetric, how is it useful for anything other than link-level
encryption with an identical chip at each end? how can you negotiate
a per-session key using symmetric cryptography without using a trusted
third party who knows your key? (or does it even use a per-session
key?)
if it's asymmetric, what about pkp's patents, which they claim cover
all methods of doing asymmetric cryptography? are they getting
royalties, or is hiding infringement the real reason for keeping the
algorithm secret? :-)

15287.eml,sci.crypt,"from the limited details released so far, it seems that the clipper chip
system must employ some sort of public key cryptography. otherwise, the key
management problems inherent to symetric ciphers would make the system
unworkable. it probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes place
at the start of each call. thats how they would identify the private key in
their data base?
this means that either the nsa has developed some non rsa public key
algorythm or the feds have decided to subsidize pkp rsadsi. the former is
rather an exciting posibility since keeping the algorythm secret while making
chip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard. if the feds
are forced to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that
could break rsa's stranglehold on public key crypto in the u.s.
as for my impressions of the whole scheme it seems that instead of trying to
ban strong crypto, they are trying to co-opt it. their contention that they
need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key
registration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm. more likely
is that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont
have the keys registered. anyone else notice that in their q a session, they
talk about releasing the keys only to people with proper autiorization but
carefully dance around stating that the keys will simply have to be supeonaed.
they seem to be trying to keep open the posibility of obtaining keys without
court order even though tapping a phone line requires one. also pick up on
their implicit threat of eithe accept this or we'll ban strong crypto outright?

the white house
office of the press secretary for immediate release april 16, 1993
statement by the press secretary
the president today announced a new initiative that will bring
the federal government together with industry in a voluntary
program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law
enforcement.
the initiative will involve the creation of new products to
accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.
for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our
private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the
tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of
protecting americans. rather than use technology to accommodate
the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and
law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against
industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.
sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to
protect electronic funds transfer. it is now being used to
protect electronic mail and computer files. while encryption
technology can help americans protect business secrets and the
unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used
by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.
a state-of-the-art microcircuit called the ""clipper chip"" has
been developed by government engineers. the chip represents a
new approach to encryption technology. it can be used in new,
relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to
an ordinary telephone. it scrambles telephone communications
using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in
commercial use today.
this new technology will help companies protect proprietary
information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
electronically. at the same time this technology preserves the
ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to
intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.
a ""key-escrow"" system will be established to ensure that the
""clipper chip"" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding
americans. each device containing the chip will have two unique
2
""keys,"" numbers that will be needed by authorized government
agencies to decode messages encoded by the device. when the
device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately
in two ""key-escrow"" data bases that will be established by the
attorney general. access to these keys will be limited to
government officials with legal authorization to conduct a
wiretap.
the ""clipper chip"" technology provides law enforcement with no
new authorities to access the content of the private
conversations of americans.
to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the
attorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the new
devices. in addition, respected experts from outside the
government will be offered access to the confidential details of
the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
their findings.
the chip is an important step in addressing the problem of
encryption's dual-edge sword: encryption helps to protect the
privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield
criminals and terrorists. we need the ""clipper chip"" and other
approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access
to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it
to hide their illegal activities. in order to assess technology
trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),
the president has directed government agencies to develop a
comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:
employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;
calls and data, under proper court or other legal
order, when necessary to protect our citizens;
technology to build the national information
infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and
the competitiveness of american industry in the global
marketplace; and
high technology products.
the president has directed early and frequent consultations with
affected industries, the congress and groups that advocate the
privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.
3
the administration is committed to working with the private
sector to spur the development of a national information
infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer
technologies to give americans unprecedented access to
information. this infrastructure of high-speed networks
(""information superhighways"") will transmit video, images, hdtv
programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone
system transmits voice.
since encryption technology will play an increasingly important
role in that infrastructure, the federal government must act
quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding
its use. the administration is committed to policies that
protect all americans' right to privacy while also protecting
them from those who break the law.
further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.
the provisions of the president's directive to acquire the new
encryption technology are also available.

questions and answers about the clinton administration's
telecommunications initiative
q: does this approach expand the authority of government
agencies to listen in on phone conversations?
a: no. ""clipper chip"" technology provides law enforcement with
no new authorities to access the content of the private
conversations of americans.
q: suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
encrypted using the device. what would they have to do to
decipher the message?
a: they would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a
court order, to do the wiretap in the first place. they
would then present documentation of this authorization to
the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and
obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug
smugglers. the key is split into two parts, which are
stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key
escrow system.
q: who will run the key-escrow data banks?
a: the two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent
entities. at this point, the department of justice and the
administration have yet to determine which agencies will
oversee the key-escrow data banks.
q: how strong is the security in the device? how can i be sure
how strong the security is?
a: this system is more secure than many other voice encryption
systems readily available today. while the algorithm will
remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow
system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of
cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
potential users that there are no unrecognized
vulnerabilities.
q: whose decision was it to propose this product?
a: the national security council, the justice department, the
commerce department, and other key agencies were involved in
this decision. this approach has been endorsed by the
president, the vice president, and appropriate cabinet
officials.
q: who was consulted? the congress? industry?
a: we have on-going discussions with congress and industry on
encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify
as we carry out our review of encryption policy. we have
briefed members of congress and industry leaders on the
decisions related to this initiative.
q: will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?
a: the government designed and developed the key access
encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the
microcircuits to product manufacturers. product
manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip
manufacturer that produces them.
q: who provides the ""clipper chip""?
a: mykotronx programs it at their facility in torrance,
california, and will sell the chip to encryption device
manufacturers. the programming function could be licensed
to other vendors in the future.
q: how do i buy one of these encryption devices?
a: we expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating
the ""clipper chip"" into their devices.
q: if the administration were unable to find a technological
solution like the one proposed, would the administration be
willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
powerful encryption devices?
a: this is a fundamental policy question which will be
considered during the broad policy review. the key escrow
mechanism will provide americans with an encryption product
that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive
than others readily available today, but it is just one
piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to
encryption technology, which the administration is
developing.
the administration is not saying, ""since encryption
threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,
we will prohibit it outright"" (as some countries have
effectively done); nor is the u.s. saying that ""every
american, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
unbreakable commercial encryption product."" there is a
false ""tension"" created in the assessment that this issue is
an ""either-or"" proposition. rather, both concerns can be,
and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,
balanced approach such as is proposed with the ""clipper
chip"" and similar encryption techniques.
q: what does this decision indicate about how the clinton
administration's policy toward encryption will differ from
that of the bush administration?
a: it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption
technology in telecommunications and computing and are
committed to working with industry and public-interest
groups to find innovative ways to protect americans'
privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law
enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime
and terrorism.
q: will the devices be exportable? will other devices that use
the government hardware?
a: voice encryption devices are subject to export control
requirements. case-by-case review for each export is
required to ensure appropriate use of these devices. the
same is true for other encryption devices. one of the
attractions of this technology is the protection it can give
to u.s. companies operating at home and abroad. with this
in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a
case-by-case basis for u.s. companies seeking to use these
devices to secure their own communications abroad. we plan
to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability
of these products. without prejudice ucc 1-207 (pat myrto) seattle, wa

the sdns protocols, for example, make explicit provision for multiple
encryption systems, as does pem. (and i'd love to see how they'd
mandate this new system for pem without disclosing it....)
mind you, i'm not saying that multiple algorithms will actually be
used -- but the relevant technologies certainly provide for them, which
certainly casts doubt on your choice of words."
15292.eml,sci.crypt,"rsa might be in position to do it, if they had active cooperation of
a couple of manufacturers of cellular phones or desktop phones.
large companies in the voice data comm business are out, because they
all have contracts with the gov which would be used to pressure them.
if we, as professionals in crypto organizations, eff, etc. were to
put our collective minds and interests toward establishing a
crypto standard for transmission, and getting our companies to
implement it, we might avoid government control.
otherwise, i think it will happen to us by default. gov isn't probably
strong enough or foolish enough to prevent strong crypt. they
are strong enough, and we may be foolish enough, to push through
the clipper chip.
is rsa independt of the gov enough to spearhead this? i, for one,
would gladly pay royalties via purchasing secure phones.
if not this, we should provide an algorithm which can be implemented

15295.eml,sci.crypt,"hear hear! i completely agree that we need to work quickly to
establish alternatives to the government's clinton clipper. as brad
templeton and others have noted, once the clipper becomes ensconced in
enough phones there will be enormous pressure to make it the legal standard, and it will become the ""market standard as well. (there is
a lot of confusion in the proposal about whether the use of clipper is
mandated, about whether non-escrow alternatives will be allowed, etc.)
(there are also unclear issues about how hard, or how illegal, it will
be to make ""workalikes"" which meet the standard but which generate
phony or untappable keys...i'm sure the next several weeks will see
these issues thrashed out in this and other groups.)
meanwhile, i'd be interested to hear rsa data security's reaction.
often criticized in this group for their licensing policies (the usual
complaints about mailsafe costing too much, at 125 or so, and the
general issue of software patents...), we may find that allying ourselves with rsa is the best thing we can do. what's a mere
licensing fee when our liberty may be at stake? (if everyone who
wanted true security paid, say, 100 for a lifetime use of all of
rsa's patents--which expire in the period 1998-2002, or so--then rsa
would make tons of money and be happy, i'm sure. a small price to pay.
for those to whom 100 sounds like too much, i'm sure the actual terms
could be different, spread out over several years, whatever. to me,
it's a small price to pay.)
strong crypto means strong privacy. escrowing keys, sending copies of
keys to large databases, and splitting keys into two 40-bit pieces,
all done with secret and non-analyzable protocols and algorithms, is not strong crypto!
whatever some of us may think about the abstract principles of
patenting number theory applications, this minor issue pales in
comparison with the potential dangers of the clipper proposal (note
that i said ""potential""...we'll presumably learn more in the coming
months).
the rsa algorithms are at least public, have been analyzed and
attacked for years, and source code is available (to better ensure no
deliberate weakenesses or trapdoors).
i know of a number of groups putting together voice encryption systems
using off-the-shelf hardware (like soundblaster boards for the pc) and
celp-type software. the new generations of pcs, using fast 486s and
pentiums are fast enough to do real-time voice encryption. combined
with diffie-hellman key exchange, this should provide an alternative
to the clipper system.
of course, we don't really know if the administration proposes to
outlaw competing systems. (it seems to me that their goal of tapping
terrorists, child pornographers, and hilary bashers would be thwarted
if low-cost alternatives to clipper proliferated. not to defend child
pornographers or terrorists, but limiting basic freedoms to catch a
few criminals is not the american way of doing things. end of soapbox
mode.)
i suggest we in these groups set aside any differences we may have had
with rsa (and don't look at me....i have both macpgp and a fully
legal copy of ""mailsafe""!) and instead work with them as quickly as we can.
rsa?, jim?, are you listening?

p.s. i reserve the right to retract these opinions if it should turn
out that rsa data security was involved in the clipper proposal.

15299.eml,sci.crypt,"i wish i could agree with you. ask yourself this. why would any private
sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was known to be at least
partially compromised? (key escrows in this instance) why would any
private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly
evaluated? (i.e. algorythm not publically released)
the answer seems obvious to me, they wouldn't. there is other hardware out
there not compromised. des as an example (triple des as a better one.)
my suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on these non clipper
systems. if not we're in trouble.
given that the clinton administration is not entirely stupid (although we'd like
to think so) i cannot believe that they have failed to realize this.
they know their initiative will fail, much as crippled des was never taken
seriously. the only way their moves can work is by coercion. you know
little about politics if you don't realize that this is just a first step
in the next move, it makes no sense otherwise. the next move, banning
or severly crippling crypto not using the ""clipper"" system is easily
justified ""why would anyone want other encryption unless they were trying
to subvert the government? we've provided you with a very secure alternative
so use it or go to jail be fined whatever.""
how can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing
law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper system
the only crypto available in the u.s... ? you simply can't, and the administration
knows it. anyone who wanted to keep the govt. out of their hair, be it for
drug dealing or whatever, would just buy still available non-clipper systems.
don't sell our crafty clinton types short, they can't be that stupid.
either banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administrations
collective i.q. is about that of a potato.

april 17, 1993
sir and or madam:
i must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption and
cryptography. i am shocked at the clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life.
it is apparent to me that those who drafted the ""clipper chip proposal"" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the ""big brother proposal"") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed. anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors. the proper evaluation of an algorithm dep
ends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm. the assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from ""experts"" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.
in addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as des, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy. it seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how ""tamper proof"" the key escrows might be.
i cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws. i can only assume then that the drafters of the ""clipper chip proposal"" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector. the only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion. even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti
lize the ""big brother chip.""
unfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing. i expect the big brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the american people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like ""harmony,"" ""right to encryption,"" and ""voluntary.""
it mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the clinton administration is ""i can't believe it's happening here."" more startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant; ""when is the reichstag fire planned for?""

cryptography is not a crime. fight the big brother proposal!"
15300.eml,sci.crypt,"what they would need to do, though, is make sure that nobody has
access to decent crypto in the first place. they probably can't
tell clippered voice from clippered triple-desed voice until they
get their copy of your key. any criminal who's going to use
encryption will do it under cover of clipper. the only way to avoid
this will be to try to prohibit strong encryption.
i probably shouldn't say this, but they could try to detect the use
of an illegal cypher by transmitting in the clear some statistical
properties of the plaintext. an old-fashioned wiretap could then
detect the use of pre-encryption, which would drastically increase
the measured entropy of the input. a countermeasure to this would
be to use steganographic techniques which put out voice.

rogers' methods were used extensively during the world war, and was
unclassified after the war. supposedly, the government rethought this
soon after, and rogers was convieniently forgotten.
the bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send half of
their signal thru the ground. the half that travels thru space is
quickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that which
travels thru the ground does not disapate at all. furthermore,
the published data showed that when noise drowned out regular
reception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.

52464.eml,sci.electronics,"first of all, realize that tesla invented ac power generators, motors,
transformers, conductors, etc. technically, all transformers are tesla
coils. in general though when someone refers to a tesla coil, they mean
an ""air core resonant transformer"". the tv flyback version tesla
coil (see the encyclopedia of electronic circuits v3, 106-1 for
diagram) has not an air core. it is of a class of circuit called
""oscillating shuttle circuit"" (osc). generally osc's are highly
efficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors,
which are very lossy devices. typically tesla used active
reactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve
efficiencies of 99.5 , and better. the usual application of an air-core
resonant transformer, or of an osc, is to produce strong emi
for wireless broadcasts. how well do you think your computer

from it? if we were to remove from our homes and industries all

alternative to a standard 100mhz analogue cro. this instrument has
a 100mhz, 500ms s spec, meaning that it is always in real time
capture mode. the pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in
the range. the downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at
least they appear to be logically laid out.
one more thing about the new, ""simpler"", front panels. these instruments
tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. this is a vast improvement
over the old oak switch. the single most common cause of failure in our
scopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these
switches. i look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the
longevity of the instruments.

52742.eml,sci.electronics,"i'm trying to figure out how to operate a pioneer laserdisc ld-1000 that i bought at a surplus store. it is reputedly from some kind of computerised viewing
and or ordering system. there is what may be an hpib connector on the back. when
i power it up, the front panel power light comes on, but no activity, and the
door doesn't open. anyone have any experience with this unit or any ideas on how
to obtain documentation?"
52743.eml,sci.electronics,"firstly, i would never consider trying to make a one-shot timer. your 2f2 cap
will have been designed as a ram battery substitute, rather than for use in
applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. their
performance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap.
the other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5 20 tolerances,
so calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering
the cold).
you should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain,
that ""rolls over"" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every
1,209,600 seconds. if you were to use something like a 110hz clock, you would
need a divider chain of 2 27, to give an error of less than one percent in the
firing times over the six week period. of course, you could trim the 110hz
oscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator
remaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.
i would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the
solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.
caveat - i'm not experienced in low temperature electronics, so i can't
guarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable
conditions.

120v rtn ! ! note: no mods to wiring to the right of this point.
only one blinker is used.
note that the blinker would not have as much current thru it as the
string 1 bulbs, because of the second string of bulbs in
parallel with it. that's why the use of the 10k 5w resistor
here to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the
current shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing
and the second string is not glowing. when the blinker goes open,
this resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the
strings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.
or use a 3w 120v bulb in place of the 10k resistor if you can get
one. caution, do not replace with a standard c9 bulb, as these
draw too much current and burn out the blinker. c9 approx 7w.
what you'll see when it's working: powerup, string 1 will light
at full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current
from the second string, making them not light. b will open, placing
both strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a
low brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow
at reduced brightness.

52758.eml,sci.electronics,"good gravy! decibels are all ratios. the question that remains in
any ratio is the reference unit used. sometimes, this will be a reference
power, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which
should also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms
in an rf circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted
notation of dbm. maybe it might be dbv, disregarding the impedance of
the circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference amplitude (rather than reference power). or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted
reference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain db.
so. look at it this way--'db' has an implied reference while notation
such as 'dbm' has an explicit reference.
for power:
db 10 log( p(measured) p(reference) )
for amplitude
db 20 log( a(measured) a(reference) )
'b' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base
10, named after alexander graham bell. a 'deci' bel is 1 10 of a bel.
it has nothing to do with the bell telephone company except for
the common founder's name. the small 'd' large 'b' is per si notation
convention. i don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.
common references for audio are:
0 dbm 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms
0 dbv 1 volt
0 vu (a zero on the vu meter) 4 dbm (pro gear line level)
0 vu -10dbv	(consumer gear line level)
often times, a power amp vu meter will be aligned using
the rated power of the amp as the 0 db point. it is all
done to whatever reference is reasonable for the application
or moment.
note that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear
impedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the
power will also increase the same amount. this proof can be done
with the above two identities and ohm's law.

i can't even imagine what i could do with self-modifing hardware.
i can imagine self-modifying software,
and even though all my teachers say that's bad, even worse than goto,
check out what the experts used to say about self-modifying code:
(he uses ""orders"" rather than ""opcodes"")
""on the principles of large scale computing machines""
by goldstine and von neumann,
collected in john von neumann: collected works, vol. v reprinted here with absolutely no permission from anyone.
""we plan... to have a full size (40 binary digit) word hold
either contain
1 full size number (... equivalent to 12 decimal digits,
but we will use the first binary digit to denote the sign)
or two (20 binary digit) orders.
....
it should be added that this technique of
automatic substitutions into orders,
i.e. the machine's ability to modify its own orders
(under the control of other ones among its orders)
is absolutely necessary for a flexible code. thus, if
part of the memory is used as a ""function table"", then
""looking up"" a value of that function for a value of the
variable which is obtained in the course of the computation
requires that the machine itself should modify, or
rather make up, the reference to the memory in the order which
controls this ""looking up"", and the machine can only make this
modification after it has already calculated the value of the
variable in question.
on the other hand, this ability of the machine to modify its
own orders is one of the things which makes coding
the non-trivial operation which we have to view it as.""

micro and a crystal will do the job reliably and easily. an 8748 only
costs about 5. that and a 1 crystal and you're in business. embed
the whole thing in a foam insulated blanket, power it from a solar cell,
use the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and rely
on the insulation to hold the heat during darkness. if you don't want
to try thermal management, contact someone like icl and have them cut
you a special low temperature crystal. it'll cost at most 20.
if you use a single chip micro, you're looking at a parts count of
maybe 7. a processor, a crystal, two caps on the crystal, a power fet
to fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery. this is fewer parts than
you can build an analog timer for and is infinitely more reliable. add
a power zener diode (for heat) and a solar cell and the parts count
screams up to 9.
pd assemblers are available for all the common single chip micros. this
application is so trivial you could even look up the op codes in the

52786.eml,sci.electronics,"i've just built a valve preamp and use a diode capacitor
voltage multiplier to step the 12vac supply voltage up to approx
260vdv. as the load resistance increases, the rc constant decreases
and hence the output voltage drops. i need as high an output
voltage as possible. (about 260v).
the circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages
(ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v
across them, and i take the output from across seven capacitors 260v.
each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v.
if i increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will
increase the rc constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem.
these capacitors are going to be a little expensive as i need 14 of
them, so:
1. what would happen if i connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel
with the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?
will it, as i assume, increase the c in circuit and hence increase
the rc time constant? if it does, and my output voltage becomes more
stable by doing this, then i will have killed two birds with one stone...
as i am experiencing some 50hz ripple (and hence amp hum), and this new
capacitor will 'smooth' this out.
and
2. can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor (choke) to
be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out
the 50hz mains hum. lowest resistance possible !

52790.eml,sci.electronics,"i think the hangup with digital scopes is that you have to know so much
more about them and how they work on a scope-by-scope basis, and
some of the functions are typically presented, in my opinion,
in a counter-intuitive fashion (hp has made some strides in their
54600 series, imo). automatic setups are fine for simple,
repetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more
complex events where you need to understand how the scope is
actually measuring processing the event. for example, is the scope
in ""equivalent time"" or in ""real time"" sampling mode (equivalent time
being a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to
the trigger event each sweep)? what was the scope's actual sampling
rate at the time? how is the data being massaged after capture but
before display, etc. one common misconception is the speed of the scope.
is the hp scope you're using really a 100 mhz scope? or is it a 20 mhz
sample rate scope ( 5 mhz single shot significance) whose front
end including s h can support 100 mhz waveforms (important for
equivalent time sampling)? the 100 mhz input in this case really
only helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single
sample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.
so, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get
useful information from a digital scope. i prefer an analog scope for
general use and the digital for events where i need storage for
later analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability
of the scope. now, for the price of true 100 mhz digital scopes to
fall...

silly. however, ""decibel"" is in fact 1 10th of a bel. he is
right on that one, but i don't know if it was accidental or not.
strictly defined, a bel is the ratio of the log of two power levels,

it used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for
an officer to actually see the radar detector. not any more! many
law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors.
right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up rf
from the radar detector itself. my first reaction was ""no way!""

is what they want - and yes, what the law says, and i intend to
obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.
for my fellow hams, i am not a microwave person - my mind only

what do the radar detector detectors actually detect?

picnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a
couple of heat sinks. the biggest device can shift 60w with an
efficiency of 80-90 , which ain't bad (although it would flatten my
car battery in about half an hour).
unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic
specs as a heat pump. i imagine that you would get a back-emf as the
temperature gradient across the device increases. if so, presumably
its power decreases as the back-emf increases, until eventually we
have a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no
leakage). if so, then the final temperature difference between the
two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more
(although that would be a lousy way to control it).

2: can anyone design an amplifier that preferentially amplifies
hole currents over normal electron currents?
3: what semiconductor materials have the highest ratio of

test samples rather than estimates based on theory. also,
don't be limited to semiconductors: consider also insulators,
resistors, dielectrics, piezo-electrics, conductors,
magnets (metal, ceramic), magnetostrictives, etc).
notes:
to summarize, this thread has so far stated that the only area
where holes are not detectable is the vacuum. that is, hole
particles only exist in the presence of matter.
previous threads have stated that holes only exist in certain
semi-conductors. the question that naturally arises is if
the hole currents inside a semi-conductor vanish at the point
where the semiconductor is joined to a conductor (say, copper).
i don't want a theoretical discussion here about whether
holes could exist inside metal conductors, rather i ask for
an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such
currents if they exist.

run it into, say, a voltage divider made of 990 ohms in series with 10

things to check:
first check for a shorted high power component. your best bet is the vertical
output transistor(s) or, if there is one, the voltage regulator. the most
common cause of this type of failure is too much current being drawn
somewhere.
also look for shutdown circuits (which your tv may or may not have),

unfortunately, there are not too many retail outlets that'll stock
just about every chip made. the stuff they will stock are the ones
that'll sell, like standard dram's, 80386's, 68000's, etc,etc.
i.e. i cna't think of any 'one-stop-shopping' store.
the closest you can get is to pick up a copy of byte magazine or
the circuit cellar, popular electronics, and the like and flip
through them.
distributors like wyle electronics, hamilton avnet, pioneer electronics,
etc, etc, don't normally deal with end-users like ourselves where
we only a couple of everything...they only deal with people who buy
by the hundreds or more. each distributor represents and sells a variety of
different non-competing manufacturers. what do i mean by this?
suppose abc electronics sells intel 80386's. it's a pretty good
bet that they won't be selling any of amd's 386's, or vice-versa.
they also can obtain just about any chip you want from a manufacturer
they represent.
who knows? you might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them.
but i'd be suprised if you do. also bear in mind that the 1 or 2
qty prices they will charge you will be much greater than what
a mail order outlet will charge.
my advice? if you're gonna be designing anything, try to stick
with off-the-shelf stuff. you're going to get stuck if you use
too many esoteric parts sooner or later.

53539.eml,sci.electronics,"well, one reason for getting conflicting answers is that it depends on
what you want the ground plane to do. a continuous conductor is a good
electrostatic shield. do you have signals on your board that need
shielding rom other things? this shielding won't do much good for magnetic
fields, unless you make it continuous around the circuit to be shielded,
like a faraday cage.
the flip side of the coin: if you are working with (very) high impedances,
you could end up with capacitances to the gound plane that cause problems.

they aren't designed, they evolved. and, much as it discomforts us, in
humans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and
cranial size. wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do.
domestic horses and cows typically have a worse time. to give you an idea:
my family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great-
grandfathers had several wives, and we never could figure out which wife
had each child. one might ask why this happened. my great-great-
grandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperous
farmers. nonetheless, they lost several wives each to the rigors of
childbirth; the graveyards in spencer, indiana, and boswell, north dakota,
contain quite a few gravestones like ""ida, wf. of jacob liptrap, and
baby, may 6, 1853.""
more like one in ten. and the consequences can be devastating; i have
direct experience of more than a dozen victims of a fouled-up breech birth.
it isn't always fatal. but it is often fatal, when it happens out of
reach of adequate help. more often, it permanently damages one's health.
clearly women's bodies evolved to give birth (i am no believer in divine
design); however, evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans.
my, aren't we wroth! i haven't read a more outrageous straw man attack
in months! i can practically see your mouth foam.
we're statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks. although
i can't produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we looked
them up, rest assured that we balanced c-section risks against other risks.
i wouldn't encourage my wife to have a caesarean unless it was clearly
indicated; on the other hand, i am opposed (on obvious grounds) to waiting
until an emergency to give in.
and bear this in mind: my wife took the lead in all of these decisions.
we talked things over, and i did a lot of the leg work, but the main
decisions were really hers.
i don't know of very many home birth advocates, even, that think that
a first-time mother should have her baby at home.
but people should bother to find out the relative risks. my wife was
unwilling to take any significant risks in order to have nice surroundings.
in view of the intensity of the birth experience, i doubt surroundings
have much importance anyway. somehow the values you're advocating seem
all lopsided to me: taking risks, even if fairly small, of serious
permanent harm in order to preserve something that is, after all,
an esthetic consideration.

another option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start

in some situations it is useful. ditto stuff like licorice root. taking
anything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the idea
of taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted,
additional effects. taking any drug when the potential ill-effects are
not known is a risk assumed by the parties involved, and it may be that
in a given situation the risk is worthwhile.
like prozac, for instance; prozac has been shown to be theraputic in
some cases where the tri-cyclics fail. but prozac hasn't been in use
that long, and it really isn't clear what if any effects it may have
when taken over long periods of time, even though it has been tested
by present day standards. should prozac be taken off the market because
long-term effects, if any, are not known? imho, i'd say no.

the crew rest requirements are to prevent undue fatigue. the cockpit
crew (pilot) limits are somewhat more stringent than the cabin crew
limits for this reason. crew rest requirements address amount of time
on duty plus rest time. a tired crew is an accident-prone crew.
the only limits i know of for inner-ear problems are in military
aircraft, which are frequently unpressurized or less reliably
pressurized. not being able to clear the ears renders aircrew members
dnif (duties not involving flying) or grounded until the ears clear.
flying can accentuate problems if ears don't clear. if you don't have
big pressure changes, you may not know that you've got a problem. but
if you zip up to 5,000 or 6,000 ft (the usual cabin altitude in an
airliner) and then back down to sea level, you may discover a problem.
ears don't clear readily because of allergies, colds, infections, and

side of the body, and can be complete or partial. it is interesting
medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part
by the ""normal"" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in

whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is

diseases associated with clubbing is quite long, and includes

58109.eml,sci.med,"the other pain source i have is chronic lower back pain resulting in
bilateral radiculopathy. i've had mris, xrays, ct scan, and emgs
(i've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with
nerve conduction tests. the tests have not been conclusive as to
what is causing my back and leg pain. the mri reports both say i have
several bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the xrays (and mri, i think)
it is apparent that i have arthritis. the reading on the ct scan
was that there are two herniations (l3-l4, and l4-l5), but others
hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations.
the second emg and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation
compared to the first emg. oh yeah, i had some other horrible test,
called something like somatic evoked response which showed that the
""internal nerves"" are working fine. anyway, the bottom line is that
i sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain. the back pain
is there all the time, but i can live with it. when the leg pain is there,
i need some analgesic anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain
to a level where i can work. so i took naprosyn regulary for 6-9
months (every time i tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so i'd
always resume). since last november i have taken it much less frequently,
and primarily for the pelvic pain. i have been going to physical
therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week). after the first month
or so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier,
but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at
a lower weight). after a month or two, the pain in my legs began going
away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which
could be reduced with ultrasound and massage). so now, i don't have
nearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off
traction about 2 weeks ago.
getting back to my original reason for this post... even if i can avoid
taking analgesic for headaches, i really can't avoid them entirely because
i have other pain sources, that ""force"" me to use them (oh, i forgot
to mention that it has been suggested to me that i have back surgery,
but i'm avoiding that too). i find the migraines difficult to deal with,
occassionally i have to take off work, but usually i can work, but at
a reduced capacity (i'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading
and writing). when the pelvic pain is bad, i can't concentrate much,
i usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because
the pain is so bothersome. when the pain in my back is bad, it can
cause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric
shock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad
i can't really sit at all. then i end up spending most of my time home
and in bed. so even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the
migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources. i get a lot
of migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days.
i've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so
i reduced the dosage), but i don't like the side effects (if i take
more than two i get diahrea). if i get a very bad headache, i will
eventually take the cafergot. my neurologist wasn't very helpful when
i told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan
becomes available, i should try that. i've tried several other medications
(fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but
they either didn't work, or i couldn't tolerate them. so what can i do?
my doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the
pain, which i agree with most of the time, but not when i have a lot of
pain. i've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped
once from the anesthesia - i was told that it was likely the
succinylcholine), and i've already had surgery several times.
anyway, the point of what i'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute
to migraines, some people need to take them to tolerate other pain.

really only gets miserable pimples when it's dry.
frequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. getting the scalp
thing under control might help (that could be as simple as submerging under
the bathwater till it's softened and washing it out). taking a one a day
vitamin mineral might help. i've heard iodine causes trouble and that it
is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be
where the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. i notice grease
on my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating

keeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help. warm
water bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will
help prevent blackheads. body oil is hydrophilic, loves water and it
softens and washes off when it has a chance. that's why hair goes limp with
oilyness.
becoming convinced that the best thing to do with
a whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. any
prying of black or whiteheads can cause infections, the red spots of
pimples. usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there won't

b. as a lo-o-o-ong time sufferer of tinnitus and as a neuroscientist
who has looked over the literature carefully i believe the following
are reasonable conclusions:
1. millions of people suffer from chronic tinnitus.
2. the cause it not understood.
3. there is no accepted treatment that cures it.
4. some experimental treatments may have helped some people a bit, but
there have be no reports--even anecdotal--of massive good results with
any of these experimental drugs.
5. some people with chronic loud tinnitus use noise blocking to get to sleep.
6. sudden onset loud tinnitus can be caused by injuries and sometimes
abates or goes away after a few months.
7. aspirin is well known to exacerbate tinnitus in some people.
8. there is a national association of tinnitus sufferers in the us.
9. one usually gets used to it. especially when concentrating on
something else the tinnitus becomes unnoticed.
10. stress and lack of sleep make tinnitus more annoying, sometimes.
11. i'm sure those of us who have it wish there was a cure, but there
is not.

58112.eml,sci.med,"1. reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.
some people get tiny red bites. others (like me) are more
sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.
2. chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving. i swear
that these things will itch for months.
3. there is a lot of folklore about chiggers. i think most of
it is fiction. i have tried to do research on the critters,
since they have such an effect on me. the only book i could
find on the subject was a single book in unc's special
collections library. i have not yet gone through what is
required to get it.
4. based on my experience and that of my family members, the old
folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work. i recall
reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers
burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false. i
think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some
sort the little pests release. but this is speculation.
5. the best approach is prevention. a couple of things work well.
a good insect repellent (deet) such as deep woods off liberally
applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start. there is
another preparation called ""chig away"" that is a combination of
sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was
prepared for the army and is not commercially available. in
the summer i put this on my ankles every morning when i get
up on weekends since i literally can't go outside where we
live (in the country) without serious consequences. (they
apparently don't like sulfur much at all. you can use sulfur
as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)
6. no amount of prevention will be completely successful. forget
the fingernail polish. i have finally settled upon a treatment
that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone
creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine
(relieves the itch). i won't tell you all the things i've tried.
nor will i tell you some of the things my wife does since this
counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (i also think
it gains nothing).
7. the swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved
by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery
as well.
doctors seem not to care much about chiggers. the urban and suburban
doctors apparently don't encounter them much. and the rural doctors
seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure. i
suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers
would make a lot of money.

i'd be happy to go over the insert (in the pdr) with them and explain
everything. all too many patients read the insert and panic and then
on the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug
and we are starting over again at square one. some of them probably
didn't even come back for followup because they didn't want to admit
they wouldn't take the drug or thought i was trying to kill them or
something. what people don't understand about the inserts is that they
report every adverse side effect ever reported, without substantiating
that the drug was responsible. the insert is a legal document to slough
liability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to
happen. if patients want to have the most useful and reliable information
on a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the
ama drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific.
there are very few drugs that someone hasn't reported a death from taking.
patients don't realize that and don't usually appreciate the risks
to themselves properly. i'm sure herman is going to ""go ballistic"",

reported to cause impotence. half the males who read that will falsely assume
it could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will
refuse to take any drug like that. this can be a real problem for
pdr readers. there needs to be some way of providing patients with
tools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need.
i am involved in a research project to do that, with migraine as the
domain. it involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions
about migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient.
for common illnesses, such as migraine and hypertension, this may help
quite a bit. the patient could spend as much time as needed with the
computer and this would then not burden the physician. clearly,
physicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have,
as is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked
things that the patients should have found out from their physician
but didn't. why they didn't isn't always the physician's fault either.

as rods respond to certain parts of the visible spectrum (bluegreen

the spectrum etc. it is a common misconception to confound wavelength
specificity with being color sensitive, however the two are not
synonymous.
so in sum and to beat a dead horse:
(1) when the outputs of a cone are matched for number of
absorbed photons irrespective of the absorbed photons wavelength,
the cone outputs are indistinguishable .
(2) cones are simply detectors with different spectral
sensitivities and are not any more ""color sensitive"" than are rods,

sample different parts of the spectrum (cones in this case) are

( some of these remedies also work against aids. )
disclaimer: this list was compiled from unorthodox sources
that have shown themselves to be reliable. the compiler of
this list is not a doctor of any kind, but is exercising his
first amendment constitutional right of free speech on the
subjects of his choice.
( most of these remedies can be found in any grocery store.
most of the rest of them can be found in any health food
store. what is important is how they are used, and what
else is excluded during their use. )
(1) the 7-day fast.
1st day: eat as much fresh fruit as you want, one kind
at a time, preferably grapes.
2nd day: eat all the vegetables you want, at least half
raw, including garlic; also, whole kernel corn to help scrape
clean the intestinal linings.
3rd day: drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice
you want. preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune
juice with pulp, followed by a gallon of pure (not from
concentrate) apple juice, then grape juice. (stay close to
your home bathroom.)
4th day: eat all the un-salted nuts (no peanuts) and
dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (almonds
contain laetrile.).
5th day: one gallon of lemonade. squeeze the juice from
two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and
add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (no sugar).
drink one glass per hour. everyone, including healthy people, should do this one day
every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice with
pulp. 6th day: same as 5th day.
7th day: same as 6th day.
all 7 days, eat only the foods listed above for each
day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements,
plus as much distilled water as you want.
(2) the grape diet.
eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 am to
8 pm, every day for six days. eat nothing else during the
six days, but drink as much distilled water as you want.
(3) apple cider vinegar.
mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (not apple
cider ""flavored"" vinegar. regular vinegar is harmful.) in a
glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it.
do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a
week. repeat if desired. do this along with a normal
healthy diet of natural foods. this remedy is especially
effective against those types of cancer that resemble a
fungus, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections.
(4) the sea-salt soda bath. please keep an open mind. fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level
comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in.
immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely
dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of sun-evaporated sea-salt
(regular salt won't work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda.
soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising
your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your
stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down,
chomping your teeth together, etc..
among other things, the sea-salt soda bath neutralizes
the accumulated effects of x-rays, etc., as described in the
book ""born to be magnetic, vol. 2"", by frances nixon, 1973.
precautions: only the one person using each bath should
prepare it and drain it.
for at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away
from, and even out of sight of, other people. (your greatly
expanded aura energy-field during that time could disrupt
other people's fields.) two hours after the bath, eat at
least 8 ounces of yogurt containing active yogurt cultures.
(the bath may kill friendly bacteria also.) better yet, take
a 2-billion-bacteria ""acidophilus"" capsule, which is also an
excellent daily remedy against the effects of ""a.i.d.s.""
(because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the
digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune
system). because this external bath can kill in-ternal
bacteria, it may also be a cure for ""lyme disease"". do not take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder
storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during ""major"" or
""minor periods"" as listed in the ""solunar tables"" published
bimonthly in ""field stream"" magazine, (because of the
measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields
present at those times).
do not take this bath more than four times per year.
(5) miscellaneous natural anti-cancer remedies:
for skin cancer, apply stabilized aloe vera jel to the
affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons
per day of stabilized aloe vera juice internally, for
about 2 months.
d.m.s.o. (dimethyl sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to
perform normal cell functions.
almonds (un-blanched, un-roasted) contain laetrile.
to help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.
to help cure cancer, eat several ounces of almonds per
day. never take large concentrated doses of laetrile orally.
it will kill you! take it intravenously only. (cancer
cells contain a certain enzyme which converts laetrile
into cyanide, which then kills the cell. this enzyme is
also present in the digestive system.) anti-oxidants are free-radical scavengers, and include
vitamin e, selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most
people.), chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), vitamin a
(25,000 iu per day is safe for most people.), superoxide
dismutase (up to 4,000,000 units per day), vitamin c (up
to 3000 mg. per day), and bht (butylated hydroxy-
toluene), 1 to 4 capsules of bht every night at bedtime
will also make one immune against herpes (both types),
suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes,
prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not
cure herpes. bht might also do these things against
""a.i.d.s."", which is really a form of cancer similar to
leukemia. (see the book ""life extension"", by durk
pearson and sandy shaw.)
hydrogen-peroxide. dilute twelve(12) drops of 3 hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably
distilled) and drink it. do this once or twice per day,
hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.
apply 3 hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers
several times per day.
use hydrogen-peroxide only if you are taking a good
daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants
described above.
vitamin mineral supplements are more effective, and
much less expensive, when combined together in mega
doses into single tablets made from natural sources.
cancer cells can not live in a strong (100,000 maxwell)
north magnetic field, especially if it is pulsating on
and off. a strong south magnetic field is an
aphrodisiac. in my opinion, all types of ionizing-
radiation treatments for cancer should be replaced with
daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-maxwell north
magnetic fields.
properly made and operated radionics psionics machines
can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well
as most other medical problems. some radionics psionics
machines can even take cross-sectional x-ray-like photos
of cancer tumors, etc., with-out x-rays!
interferon tablets.
taheebo tea, (lapacho).
homeopathy can cure cancer, and many other medical
problems (even drug addiction!).
50 mg. per day of chelated zinc can help prevent or cure
prostate trouble.
this list is not exhaustive.
the above natural remedies can cure both diagnosed and un-
diagnosed cancers, as well as prevent them, and also prevent
and cure many other medical problems including heart-
diseases. they are not too simple and inexpensive to work
effectively.
besides acting on a person biologically and chemically, these
remedies, especially the 7-day fast and the grape diet, send
a strong message to one's subconscious mind, programming it
to cure the cancer.
in my opinion, if a person finds out that s he has cancer,
then s he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies
described above, in sequence (starting with the 7-day fast),
before resorting to the un-natural and expensive mutilations
and agonies poison, burn, and mutilate! of orthodox cancer
treatment organi ed-crime! .

58154.eml,sci.med,"thanks in advance!
brent e. shelley"
58155.eml,sci.med,"all true. and all good points.
well, making a career out of it is a bit strong. i still believe
that doing your own research is very, very necessary. i would
not have progressed as much as i have today, unless i had spent
the many hours in stanford's med library as i have done.
and 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine that
would help me. so should i have stopped searching. thank
goodness i didn't. now i found that there is indeed medicine
that helps me.
i think that what you've said is kind of idealistic. that you
would go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a second
opinion, and then move on with your life.
just as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in
this field in the country, i have received 6 different diagnoses.
these are the top names, the ones that people come to from all over
the country. i have had to sort all of this out myself. going
to a support group (and in fact, heading that support group) was
helpful for a while, but after a point, i found it very
unproductive. it was much more productive to do library research,
make phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself.
a recent movie, lorenzo's oil, offers a perfect example of what
i'm talking about. if you haven't seen it, you should. it's not
a put down of doctor's and neither is what i'm saying. doctors are
only human and can only do so much. but there are those of us
out here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing
piece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.
i guess i'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird things
that is still so unknown. if i had a broken arm, or a weak heart,
or failing kidneys, i might not have the same opinion. that's because
those things are much more tangible and have much more concise
definitions and treatments. with dizziness, you just have to
decide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to
find your way out of it.
i have chosen the latter.

gif pictures of many of these products are available via anonymous ftp
from soda.berkeley.edu:pub typing-injury. (128.32.149.19) i highly
recommend getting the pictures. they tell much more than i can fit
into this file.
if you can't ftp, send me mail, and i'll uuencode and mail them to you
(they're pretty big...) using a pc's keyboard on your workstation compatibility issues
mini outline:
1. spoofing a keyboard over the serial port
2. x terminals
3. next
4. silicon graphics
5. ibm rs 6000
6. other stuff
1. spoofing a keyboard over the serial port
if you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard
(sun, hp, dec, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding
a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard. if your workstation
runs the x window system, you're in luck. you can buy a cheap used
pc, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable
to your workstation. then, run a program on the workstation to read
the serial port and generate fake x keyboard events.
the two main programs i've found to do this are kt and a2x.
a2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and
even moving among widgets on the screen. it requires a server
extension (xtest, dec-xtrap, or xtestextension1). to find out if your
server can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings
appear in the extensions list. if your server doesn't have this,
you may want to investigate compiling x11r5, patchlevel 18 or later,
or bugging your vendor.
kt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended x servers.
another program called xsendevent also exists, but i haven't seen it.
both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.
2. x terminals
also, a number of x terminals (ncd, tektronics, to name a few) use
pc-compatible keyboards. if you have an x terminal, you may be all
set. try it out with a normal pc keyboard before you go through the
trouble of buying an alternative keyboard. also, some x terminals add
extra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around
for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the setup key.
3. next
next had announced that new next machines will use the apple desktop
bus, meaning any mac keyboard will work. then, they announced they
were cancelling their hardware production. if you want any kind of
upgrade for an older next, do it now!
4. silicon graphics
silicon graphics has announced that their newer machines (indigo 2 and
beyond) will use standard pc-compatible keyboards and mice. i don't
believe this also applies to the power series machines. it's not
possible to upgrade an older sgi to use pc keyboards, except by
upgrading the entire machine. contact your sgi sales rep for more
details.
5. ibm rs 6000
ibm rs 6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal pc keyboards. unfortunately, you can't just plug one in. you need two things: a cable converter to go from the large pc keyboard connector to the smaller ps 2 style din-6, and a new device driver for aix. believe it or not, ibm wrote this device driver recently, i used it, and it works. however, they don't want me to redistribute it. i've been told judy hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact. if you learn anything new, please send me e-mail. 6. other stuff
some vendors here (notably: health care keyboard co. and accucorp)
support some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your
queries regarding supporting your own weird computer. if you can
get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either
from the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in
luck. contact the companies for more details.
apple adjustable keyboard
apple computer, inc.
sales offices all over the place.
availability: february, 1993
price: 219
supports: mac only
apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard. the
keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate
backward on a hinge. the sections do not tilt upward. the keys are
arranged in a normal qwerty fashion.
the main foldable keyboard resembles a normal apple keyboard.
a separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.
the keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not
directly attachable to the keyboard.
as soon as soda comes back up, i'll have a detailed blurb from
tidbits available there.
flexpro keyboard
key tronic
phone: 800-262-6006
possible contact: denise razzeto, 509-927-5299
sold by many clone vendors and pc shops
availability: spring, 1993 (?)
price: 489 (?)
supports: pc only (highly likely)
keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at comdex. it's
another split-design. one thumb-wheel controls the tilt of both
the left and right-hand sides of the main alphanumeric section.
the arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal 101-key pc keyboard.
keytronic makes standard pc keyboards, also, so this product will
probably be sold through their standard distribution channels.
dragondictate-30k (and numerous other dragon products)

price: dragondictate-30k -- 4995 (end user system)
dragonwriter 1000 -- 1595 2495 (end user developer system)
various other prices for service contracts, site licenses, etc.
compatibility: 386 (or higher) pc only
(3rd party support for mac)
free software support for x windows is also available -- your
pc with dragon hardware talks to your workstation over a
serial cable or network. the program is called a2x, and is
available via anonymous ftp:
soda.berkeley.edu:pub typing-injury a2x.tar.z
export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib a2x.tar.z (most current)
if you want to use your dragon product with x windows, you may want
to ask for peter cohen, an salesman at dragon who knows more about
this sort of thing.
dragon systems sells a number of voice recognition products.
most (if not all) of them seem to run on pc's and compatibles
(including ps 2's and other microchannel boxes). they sell you
a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number
of popular word processors and spreadsheets.
each user trains' the system to their voice, and there are provisions
to correct the system when it makes mistakes, on the fly. multiple
people can use it, but you have to load a different personality file
for each person. you still get the use of your normal keyboard, too.
on the dragondictate-30k you need to pause 1 10th sec between
words. dragon claims typical input speeds of 30-40 words per minute.
i don't have specs on the dragonwriter 1000.
the dragondictate-30k can recognize 30,000 words at a time.
the dragonwriter 1000 can recognize (you guessed it) 1000 words at a time.
dragon's technology is also part of the following products
(about which i have no other info):
microsoft windows sound system (voice pilot)
ibm voicetype
voice navigator ii (by articulate systems -- for macintosh)

supports: pc and mac
shipping: in beta. ""big backlog"" -- could take 3 months.
price: 2000 unit (1 unit 2 pods). (new price!) each hand has its own ""pod"". each of the four main fingers has five
switches each: forward, back, left, right, and down. the thumbs have
a number of switches. despite appearances, the key layout resembles
qwerty, and is reported to be no big deal to adapt to. the idea is
that your hands never have to move to use the keyboard. the whole pod
tilts in its base, to act as a mouse.

others to be supported later. the hardware design is relatively
easy for the company to re-configure.
price: 690, including one system ""personality module"". the idea is that one keyboard works with everything. you purchase
""compatibility modules"", a new cord, and possibly new keycaps, and
then you can move your one keyboard around among different machines.
it's a three-piece folding keyboard. the layout resembles the
standard 101-key keyboard, except sliced into three sections. each
section is on a ""custom telescoping universal mount."" each section
independently adjusts to an infinite number of positions allowing each
individual to type in a natural posture. you can rearrange the three
sections, too (have the keypad in the middle if you want). each
section is otherwise normal-shaped (i.e.: you put all three sections
flat, and you have what looks like a normal 101-key keyboard).

supports: pc. mac and sun sparc in the works.
price: 690. volume discounts available. the 690 includes one foot
pedal, one set of adhesive wrist pads, and a typingtutor program.
an additional foot pedal and other accessories are extra.
the layout has a large blank space in the middle, even though the
keyboard is about the size of a normal pc keyboard -- slightly
smaller. each hand has its own set of keys, laid out to minimize
finger travel. thumb buttons handle many major functions (enter,
backspace, etc.).
you can remap the keyboard in firmware (very nice when software won't
allow the reconfig).
foot pedals are also available, and can be mapped to any key on the
keyboard (shift, control, whatever).

doesn't use conventional push-keys. soft rubber keys, which rock
forward and backward (each key has three states), make chords for
typing keys. learning time is estimated to be 2-3 hours, for getting
started, and maybe two weeks to get used to it.
currently, the thumbs don't do anything, although a thumb-trackball
is in the works.
the company claims it takes about a week of work to support a
new computer. they will be happy to adapt their keyboard to
your computer, if possible.

changes in this version:
added information on stressfree, another typing management tool
for windows.
typing management tools: these aim to help you manage your keyboard use,
by warning you to take a break every so often. the better ones also include
advice on exercises, posture and workstation setup. some use sound hardware to
warn of a break, others use beeps or screen messages.
often, rsi appears only after many years of typing, and the pain has
a delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typing
all day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening.
these tools act as an early warning system: by listening to their
warnings and taking breaks with exercises, you don't have to wait for your
body to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is, getting rsi.
tool: at your service (commercial software)

description:
aimed at preventing rsi, this program warns you to take
breaks after a configurable interval, based on clock time, or
after a set number of keystrokes -- whichever is earlier.
it gives you 3 exercises to do each time, randomly selected from
a set of 70. exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work
you do - data entry, word processing, information processing.
exercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on
how to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does.
chb includes hypertext information on rsi that you can use
to learn more about rsi and how to prevent it. other information
on non-rsi topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer.
a full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included.
chb can be run in a dos box under windows, but does not then
warn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear
useful when used with windows.
cost: 79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses.
comments:
the keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better
to measure the activity that is causing you problems than to
measure clock time or even typing time. the marketing stuff
is very good and includes some summaries of research papers,
as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company
to pay up for rsi management tools.

all parts of your body, relieving tension and helping to prevent
repetitive strain injury. the visual training exercises will improve
your peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain. together these
help you to become more relaxed and productive.""

comments:
i have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: i would say
it is better for rsi prevention than rsi management, because it
does not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes. also, it
interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which
is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day. worked ok on
windows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a uae - not sure
why. also refused to work with the space bar on one pc, and has
one window without window controls. very usable though, and does not
require any sound hardware.

comments:
i have had a play with this, and it works ok. its user interface
design is much better in 2.0, though still a bit unusual.
expensive tool around and it does the job. it is also the only
tool with a redistributable demo, so if you do get the demo, post it
on your local bulletin boards, ftp servers and bitnet servers!
does not include general info on rsi and ergonomics, but it does
have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence,
which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises.
tool: typewatch (freeware), version 3.8 (october 1992)
available from:
email to anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub typing-injury typewatch.shar
platforms: unix (tested on sco, sunos, mach; character and x window mode)
description:
this is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you
to stop typing, based on how long you have been continuously
typing. it does not provide exercises, but it does check
that you really do take a break, and tells you when you
can start typing again.
typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing
today, each time it warns you, which is useful so you
know how much you really type. it also logs information
to a file that you can analyse or simply print out.
the warning message appears on your screen (in character mode),
in a pop-up window (for x windows), or as a zephyr message
(for those with athena stuff). tim freeman has put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for
x, zephyr and mach.
not formally supported, but email (for sco, sunos, character mode) or (for mach,
x window mode, zephyr) if you have problems or want to give
feedback.
tool: various calendar batch queue programs
available from:
various sources
platforms: various
description:
any calendar reminder program that warns you of an upcoming
appointment can be turned into an ad hoc rsi management tool.
or, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit
a program to run at a specific time to display a message to
the screen.
using windows as an example: create a calendar file, and
include this filename in your win.ini's 'load ' line so
you get it on every startup of windows. suppose you
want to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am.
press f7 (special time...) to enter an appointment, enter
9:30, hit enter, and type some text in saying what the break
is for. then press f5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat
for the next appointment.
by using windows recorder, you can record the keystrokes
that set up breaks throughout a day in a .rec file. put this
file on your 'run ' line, as above, and you will then, with
a single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments
with rsi exercises.
the above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs.
an example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job
that runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will
depend a lot on your operating system.
while these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing
yourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable rsi
management tool. if you are techie enough you might want to
write a version of typewatch (see above) for your operating
system, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.
tool: digital watches with count-down timers
available from:
various sources, e.g. casio bp-100.
description:
many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable
number of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either
manually or automatically.
while these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you
are writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from
a computer which can still cause or aggravate rsi. the great
advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you
are doing.
comments:
my own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to
my writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which
actually aggravated the rsi in my right arm though the left
arm improved. getting a count-down timer watch has been
very useful on some occasions where i write a lot in a day.
i have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but
these are not much good because they do not give an audible
warning of the end of the time period!
keyboard remapping tools: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping
so you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.
one-handed typing tools may help, but be very careful about how
you use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you
are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing,
and may therefore make matters worse.
tool: hsh (public domain)
available from:
anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub typing-injury hsh.shar
platforms: unix (don't know which ones)
description:
allows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings.
only works through tty's (so, you can use it with a terminal or
an xterm, but not most x programs).
tool: dvorak keyboard tools (various)
available from:
anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub typing-injury xdvorak.c
also built into windows 3.x.
description:
the dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout
that involves more balanced hand use. it may help prevent
rsi a bit, but you can also use it if you have rsi, since
it will slow down your typing a lot :-)

58570.eml,sci.med,"as usual, you are missing the whole point, russell, because you are not
willing to even consider questionning your basic article of faith, which
is that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highest
purpose of science is to avoid making mistakes.
this is like saying that the most important aspect of business management
is accurate bookkeeping.
if science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes, it
would be a poor thing indeed. what was the methodology of darwin? what
was the methodology of einstein? what was, for that matter, the
methodology of jenner and pasteur?
first of all, i think you are arguing against a straw man, because i
don't think that anyone here is arguing that quackery, pseudo-science,
homeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional chinese medicine should be
accepted as science. i, in particular, think the basic ideas of
homeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky.
what some of us do believe, however, is that some of these things
(including some of the flaky ideas) are deserving of serious scientific
attention.
if in fact it were true, as you have stated above, that those who do not
use the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is
effective and what is not, then science today would not exist. for all
of current science is based on the past work of scientists whose
methodology, by current standards, was seriously flawed.
it is certainly true that as methodology improves, we need to re-examine
those results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies. it is
also true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on
those early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous
fashion by those qualified to do so credibly.
but to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies is
capable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no
ideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly
be worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one's attitude as
doctrinaire, cultist. this attitude is not compatible with a belief in
reason.
in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems
less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects."

locally, soda will do it. just ask for the file, without the .z extension.
if you're unable to ftp to soda, send me e-mail and we'll see what we
can arrange. 3 general info on injuries
first, and foremost of importance: if you experience pain at all, then
you absolutely need to go see a doctor. as soon as you possibly can. the
difference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery
and a long, drawn-out ordeal. go see a doctor. now, your garden-variety
doctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury. generally,
any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in
these kinds of problems. don't wait, though. go see a doctor.
the remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, from
a wonderful report by new zealand's department of labour (occupational
safety and health service): ""occupational overuse syndrome. treatment and
rehabilitation: a practitioner's guide"".
first, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldn't have your hands):
(note: you're likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :)
rsi: repetitive strain injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries
oos: occupational overuse syndrome -- synonym for rsi
ctd: cumulative trauma disorder -- another synonym for rsi
wruld: work-related upper limb disorders -- yet another synonym for rsi
cts: carpal tunnel syndrome (see below)
hyperextension: marked bending at a joint.
pronation: turning the palm down.
wrist extension: bending the wrist up.
supination: turning the palm up.
wrist flexion: bending the wrist down.
pinch grip: the grip used for a pencil.
ulnar deviation: bending the wrist towards the little finger.
power grip: the grip used for a hammer.
radial deviation: bending the wrist toward the thumb.
abduction: moving away from the body.
overspanning: opening the fingers out wide.
now then, problems come in two main types: local conditions and diffuse
conditions. local problems are what you'd expect: specific muscles,
tendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt.
diffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle
discomfort, pain, burning and or tingling; with identifiable areas of
tenderness in muscles, although they're not necessarily ""the problem.""
normally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which
pass among the muscle fibers. when you tense a muscle, you restrict
the blood flow. by the time you're exerting 50 of your full power,
you're completely restricting your blood flow.
without fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out,
then they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates
nasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.
once one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the
load. this makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes
things worse with repetitive motion. more tension means less blood flow,
and the cycle continues.
another by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from
your nerves. they need blood too.
anyway, when you're typing too much, you're never really giving a change
for the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never
relax enough to let the blood through. stress, poor posture, and poor
ergonomics, only make things worse.
(note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic. acute
injuries are severely painful and noticable. chronic conditions have
less pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)
tenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath. chronic tenosynovitis
occurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to
cause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath's ability
to lubricate the tendon. as a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets
inflamed, and you've got your problem.
tendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon. repeated tensing of a tendon
can cause inflamation. eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating,
and can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more
swelling, and more pain. ""sub-acute"" tendonitis is more common, which entails
a dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse
with repetitive activity.
carpal tunnel syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your
fingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them. symptoms include
feeling ""pins and needles"", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation.
cts is often confused for a diffuse condition.
adverse mechanical tension -- also known as 'neural tension', this is where
the nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly
compressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere.
amt can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other oos
disorders. it is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy
(brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy).
others: for just about every part of your body, there's a fancy name for
a way to injure it. by now, you should be getting an idea of how oos
conditions occur and why. just be careful: many inexperienced doctors
misdiagnose problems as carpal tunnel syndrome, when in reality, you
may have a completely different problem. always get a second opinion
before somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery). 4 typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment
the most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce
tension in the muscles and tendons. this requires learning how to relax.
if you're under a load of stress, this is doubly important. tune out
the world and breath deep and regular. relaxing should become a guiding
principle in your work: every three minutes take a three second break.
every three minutes, take a three second break. really, do it every
three minutes. it's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings,
calm down, and relax.
if you can't sleep, you really need to focus on this. rest, sleep, and
relaxation are really a big deal.
there are all kinds of other treatments, of course. drugs can reduce
inflamation and pain. custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad
posture. surgery can fix some problems. exercise can help strengthen
your muscles. regular stretching can help prevent injury. good posture
and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension. ice or hot-cold
contrast baths also reduce swelling. only your doctor can say what's best
for you.
written in the new zealand book that i'm lifting it almost verbatim from
appendix 10. -- dwallach . let your shoulders relax.
. let your elbows swing free.
. keep your wrists straight.
. pull your chin in to look down - don't flop your head forward.
. keep the hollow in the base of your spine.
. try leaning back in the chair.
. don't slouch or slump forward.
. alter your posture from time to time.
. every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.
set the seat height, first. your feet should be flat on the floor. there
should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees,
and your thighs should not slope too much.
now, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable
to work at. if you are short, this may be impossible. the beest remedy
is to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a
footrest.
now, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space
between the backrest and the seat pan. the backrest should support you in
the hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this
area.
if you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning
back, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available. now, i diverge a little from the text a good chair makes a big difference. if you don't like your chair, go
find a better one. you really want adjustments for height, back angle,
back height, and maybe even seat tilt. most arm rests seem to get in
the way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm
rests which you can also rotate out of the way. you should find a good
store and play with all these chairs -- pick one that's right for you.
in the san francisco bay area, i highly recommend ""just chairs."" the
name says it all.
there is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right. for some
people, wrist pads seem to work wonders. however, with good posture, you
shouldn't be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your
keyboard to be ""right there"". if you drop your arms at your side and then
lift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands
when your elbows are at about 90 degrees. of course, you want to avoid
pronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs. wrist pads
may or may not help at this. you should get somebody else to come and
look at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax. it's
often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or
deviated hands.
some argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly
designed. a number of replacements are available, on the market, today.

58719.eml,sci.med,"you are making precisely one of the points i wanted to make.
i fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the process of science and the end result.
as an end result of science, one wants to get results that are
objectively verifiable. but there is nothing objective about the process of science.
if good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit
to homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information.
but it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science. this
is where you and i disagree with turpin. in order to have science, one
must have a theoretical structure that makes sense, not a mere
collection of empirically validated random hypotheses.
experiment and empirical studies are an important part of science, but
they are merely the culmination of scientific research. the most
important part of true scientific methodology is scientific thinking.
without this, one does not have any hypotheses worth testing. (no,
hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data.
nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you're shaving or
looking out the window. at least not unless you've done a lot of really
good thinking beforehand.)
the difference between a nobel prize level scientist and a mediocre
scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology.
it depends on the quality of their thinking.
it really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that
they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical
studies. and it bothers me even more that there are many fields, such as
certain parts of psychology, where there seems to be no thinking at all,
but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses.
and i'm especially offended by russell turpin's repeated assertion that
science amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes. simply avoiding
mistakes doesn't get you anywhere.
in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems
less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects."
58758.eml,sci.med,"yup. by the way, what planet are you from, and once you got here, did
you encounter those prejudices against foreign medical graduates? :: these are my opinions, not necessarily
hitachi's, though they are the opinions of all right-thinking people"
58759.eml,sci.med,"if you can taste the difference, psychological reaction might play a role.
the fact is, msg is part of natural substance. everyone, i mean everyone,
consumes certain amount of msg every day through regular diet without
the synthesized msg additive.
chinese, and many other asians (japanese, koreans, etc) have used
msg as flavor enhancer for two thousand years. do you believe that
they knew how to make msg from chemical processes? not. they just
extracted it from natural food such sea food and meat broth.
baring msg is just like baring sugar which many people react to.

58760.eml,sci.med,"there's a pretty good article in the the march 6, 1993 new scientist titled
""pouring cold water on lorenzo's oil"". the article states that research
has shown that the oil has no discernable effect on the progression of the
disease in patients in which demyelination has begun. in patients with
amn (a less acute form of the same disease) there is some improvement
seen in the ability of nerve fibres to conduct impulses. in ald patients
who have not yet begun demyelination, the jury is still out."

58762.eml,sci.med,"well, we were going along fine and the other morning, april 5, she had
a bowl of another kellog's frosted kind of cereal, fruit loops (i am
embarrassed to admit that i even bought that junk but every once
in a while...) so i pour it in her bowl and think ""oh, oh, this is the
same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure."" ten
minutes later she had a full blown seizures. this was her first exposure
to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure.
when i mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for
the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea. now
after this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even
he is scratching his head. once again her eeg looks normal which i
understand can happen even when a person has a seizure.
once again we are waiting. i have been thinking that it would be good
to get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any
experience with this kind of thing. i know that members of the medical
community are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and
foods play in our general health and well-being. anyway, as you can
guess, i am worried sick about this, and would appreciate any ideas
anyone out there has. sorry to be so wordy but i wanted to really get
across what is going on here.
thanks.

58764.eml,sci.med,"and has been rather thoroughly demolished as myth by robert scott root-
bernstein. see his book, ""discovering"". ring structures for benzene
had been proposed before kekule', after him, and at the same time as him.
the current models do not resemble kekule's. many of the predecessors
of kekule's structure resemble the modern model more.
i don't think ""extra-scientific"" is a very useful phrase in a discussion
of the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens. extra-rational
is a better phrase. in fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases
of extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.
for example, pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of
enantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a
friend's crank theory of chemical action. the friend was wrong, but
pasteur's discovery stood. a prior investigator (mitscherlich), looking
at the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he
lacked pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemic
acid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.
again, pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers
(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because
he was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid. his notebooks
contained fantasies of becoming the ""newton of mirror-image life,"" which
he never admitted publically.
perhaps the best example is the discovery that dna carries genes. avery
started this work because of one of his students, and ardent anglophile
and francophobe canadian, defended fred griffiths' discoveries in mice.
most of griffiths' critics were french, which decided the issue for the
student. avery told him to replicate griffiths' work in vitro, which the
student eventually did, whereupon avery was convinced and started the
research program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery
(avery, macleod, and mccarty, jem 1944).

general practitioner with no training in infectious diseases,
by establishing links to the ""lyme community"", treating patients
who come to him wondering about lyme or having decided they
have lyme as if they did, saying that diseases such as ms
are probably spirochetal, if not lyme, giving talks at meetings
of users groups, validating the feelings of even delusional
patients, etc. this gp can go from being a run-of-the-mill 100k yr gp to someone with lots of patients in the hospital

58766.eml,sci.med,"new data show about 100 major u.s. water supplies vulnerable to
milwaukee-type disease outbreak
to: national desk, environment writer
contact: erik olson or sarah silver, 202-783-7800, both
of the natural resources defense council
washington, april 14 -- internal epa data released
today by the natural resources defense council reveals that about
100 large water systems -- serving cities from boston to san
francisco -- do not filter to remove disease-carrying organisms
leaving those communities potentially vulnerable to a disease
outbreak similar to the one affecting milwaukee.
the epa list is attached.
""these internal epa documents reveal that the safety of water
supplies in many american cities is threatened by inadequate
pollution controls or filtration,"" said erik olson, a senior
attorney with nrdc. ""water contamination isn't just a problem in
bangladesh, it's also a problem in bozeman and boston.""
""as of june 29, 1993, about 100 large surface water systems on
epa's list probably will be breaking the law. the 1986 safe
drinking water act requires all surface water systems to either
filter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use
from pollution,"" olson continued. some systems are moving
towards eventually implementing filtration systems but are
expected to miss the law's deadline.
olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already
a reality in other cities. a 1991 survey of 66 u.s. surface
water systems by water utility scientists found that 87 percent
of raw water samples contained the milwaukee organism
cryptosporidium, and 81 percent contained a similar parasite
called giardia.
adding to the level of concern, a general accounting office
study released today by house health and environment subcommittee
chairman henry waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the
nation's system for conducting and following through on sanitary
surveys of water systems.
""this new information raises a huge warning sign that millions
of americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be
assured that their water is safe to drink. we must immediately
put into place programs to protect water sources from
contamination and where this is not assured, filtration equipment
must be installed to protect the public,"" olson noted. ""the time
has come for many of the nation's water utilities to stop
dragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from
contamination; consumers are prepared to pay the modest costs
needed to assure their water is safe to drink.""
nrdc is a national non-profit environmental advocacy organization.

58767.eml,sci.med,"i think the question is: what is extra-scientific about this?
it has been a long time since anyone has proposed restrictions on
where one comes up with ideas in order for them to be considered
legitimate hypotheses. the point, in short, is this: hypotheses and
speculation in science may come from wild flights of fancy,
daydreams, ancient traditions, modern quackery, or anywhere else.

58772.eml,sci.med,"this certainly describes my situation perfectly. for me there is
a constant dynamic between my tendency to eat, which appears to
be totally limitless, and the purely conscious desire to not
put on too much weight. when i get too fat, i just diet exercise
more (with varying degrees of success) to take off the
extra weight. usually i cycle within a 15 lb range, but
smaller and larger cycles occur as well. i'm always afraid
that this method will stop working someday, but usually
i seem to be able to hold the weight gain in check.
this is one reason i have a hard time accepting the notion
of some metabolic derangement associated with cycle dieting
(that results in long-term weight gain). i have been cycle-
dieting for at least 20 years without seeing such a change.
i think a vigorous exercise program can go a long way toward
keeping the cycles smaller and the baseline weight low.

have there been any important and documented investigations into
homeopathic principles?
i was reading a book on homeopathy over the weekend. i turned to the
section on the principles behind homeopathic medicine, and two
paragraphs informed me that homeopaths don't feel obliged to provide
any sort of explanation. the author stated this with pride, as though
it were some sort of virtue! why am i sceptical about homeopathy? is

- kekule hypothesized a resonant structure for the aromatic benzene
ring after waking from a dream in which a snake was swallowing his tail.
- archimedes formalized the principle of buoyancy while meditating in
his bath.
in neither case was there ""no connection to prior theories, concepts, etc.""

the current way of thinking, to develop ideas which subsequently proved
to have predictive power (e.g., they stood the test of experimental
verification).

tom"
58776.eml,sci.med,"yes, but typically they don't . not every wild flight of fancy serves
(or can serve) in the appropriate relation to a hypothesis. it is
somewhat interesting that when anyone is challanged to provide an
example of this sort the only one they come up with is the one about
kekule. surely, there must be others. but apparently this is regarded
as an extreme example of a ""non-rational"" process in science whereby
a successful hypothesis was proposed. but how non-rational is it?
of course we can't hope (currently at least) to explain how or why
kekule had the daydream of snakes in the fire biting their tails.
surely it wasn't the only daydream he had. what was special about this one? could it have had something to do with a perceived analogy between the geometry of the snakes and problems concerning
geometry of molecules? is such analogical reasoning ""extra-scientific""?
or is it rather at the very heart of science (perice's notion of abduction,
the use of models within and across disciplines)? upon close examination,
is there a non-rational mystical leap taking place, or is it perhaps
closer to a formal (though often incomplete) analogy or model?

spock to stonn"
58778.eml,sci.med,"i think that lee lady and i are talking at cross purposes.
above, lady seems concerned with the contrast between great
science that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocre
science that makes smaller steps. in most of this thread, i have
been concerned with the difference between what is science and
what is not.
lee lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between
einstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality of
their thought. but what is the difference between einstein and a
genius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts
are scientifically screwy? (some would give velikovsky or
korzybski as examples. if you don't like these, choose your
own.) i say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre
physicist and the mediocre proponent of qi. both einstein and
the mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the
cumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong.
both velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to
do this.
let me approach this from a second direction. when one is asked
to review a paper for a journal or conference, there are many
kinds of criticism that one can make. one kind of criticism is
that the work is just wrong or misinformed. another kind of
criticism is that the work, while technically correct, is either
not important or not interesting. the first difference is the
one that i have been pointing to. the second difference is the
one that lee lady seems to be discussing.
i have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered
scientific, what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims,
not just of some of its proposed remedies. similarly, i suspect
that traditional chinese medicine has many remedies that work;
what it lacks (as one example) is any experiment that tests the
presence of qi.
certainly a ""theoretical structure that makes sense"" is the goal.
in areas where we do not yet have this, i see nothing wrong with
forming and testing smaller hypotheses. let's face it: we cannot
always wait for an einstein to come along and make everything
clear for us. sometimes those of us who are not einstein have to
plug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can.

58779.eml,sci.med,"yeah, but the problem with holding up the ""extra-rational"" examples as

58788.eml,sci.med,"as has been noted before, there is the distinction between motivation and method . no experimental result should be accepted unless it is
described in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications
do indeed reproduce the result. no theoretical argument should be
accepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and
reasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.
but people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy
reasons. irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a
large part of the history of science.
there are a couple of negative points to make here:
1) a theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct
verification of the existence of qi. for example, quarks are an accepted
part of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification. what
would be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical
reality better than the alternatives. the central theoretical claim could
lie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of
experimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.
(i wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.
i don't think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less
a theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology. and it
is hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather
directly verifying the existence of qi.)
2) science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational
experiment-data-theory sequence. most experiments are carried out, and
interpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks. the theoretical
controversies of the day determine which experiments get done. overall,
there is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,
petty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which
computations, get done. what keeps it going forward is the critical
function of science: results don't count unless they can be replicated.
the whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test. the generate
part can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.
pasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;
but even mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;
that when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate
polarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was
indistinguishable from tartaric acid. pasteur's irrational motivation had
led to a replicable, and important, result.
this is where lysenko, creationists, etc. fail. they have usually not
even produced coherent theories that predict much of anything. when their
theories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not
concede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress
the results (lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they
think supports their position (creationists).

58792.eml,sci.med,"in science, we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible
and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these
discoveries. usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata
if 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from newton and
leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neither
of the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, since
they lacked the concept of a limit. and in fact, because of the lack of
a rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus.
it was only a hundred years later that weistrass was able to give a solid
grounding for the ideas of newton and leibniz. nonetheless, what newton
and leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great
deal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost
through the mistakes they made.
these are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and
sci.psychology. according to these posters ""if it's not supported by
carefully designed controlled studies then it's not science.""
taken to the extreme, i believe that the attitude that empirical studies
are everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification
of science.
for one thing, an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology
results in a sort of scientific trade-unionism, where those outside
the establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have
no chance to obtain a hearing. (i don't in the least believe that this
is the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology. nonetheless,
it is one of the results.) and although institutional science has
certainly produced many wonderful results, i think it is a foolish
arrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment
with anything worthwhile.
furthermore, the big bucks approach to science promotes what i think is
one of the most significant errors in science: choosing to investigate
questions because they can be readily handled by the currently
fashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutional
or corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention to
those questions which seem to have fundamental significance.
for instance, certain questions cannot be easily investigated with
statistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative.
(one could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many
areas of psychology. in my opinion, a perusal of many of the papers
resulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions
into a statistical framework gives the lie to russell turpin's
assertion that current scientific methods ""avoid all known errors."")
i think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental
error in science. (ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the
others.) and i think that scientific journals are full of all
too many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are
worthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place.
in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems
less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects."
58793.eml,sci.med,"hi janet,
sounds exactly like mine. same circumstance, same onset symptoms,
same cafergot uselessness, same duration. in fact, of all the people
i know who have migraines, none have been so similar. there is such
a wide variation between people with respect to what causes their
headaches, that i generally don't bother sharing what i've learned
about mine, but since ours seem to be alike, here are my observations.
i don't think it's heat, per se (i've had more in winter than summer).
dehydration could conceivably figure, though. try tanking up before
playing rather than after.
being in shape doesn't seem to help me much, either.
i've identified four factors that do make a difference (listed in
descending order of importance):
1) heavy exercise
2) sleep deprivation
3) fasting (e.g., skipped breakfast)
4) physical trauma	(e.g., head bonk)
heavy exercise has preceded all of my post-adolescent migraines, but i
don't get migraines after every heavy exercise session. one or more of
the other factors must be present (usually 2). since i discovered
this, i've been nearly migraine-free -- relapsing only once every two
or three years when i get cocky (""it's been so long, maybe i just don't
get them anymore"") and stop being careful.
hope this is helpful.

trauma sustained in a car accident several years ago. the psoriasis is under
control but the arthritis part of the illness is not.
ansaid (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) worked pretty well for three years but
isn't helping much now. my friend is now taking meclomen (another nsaid) but
this isn't helping control the pain at all. in the past two months my friend
has also started taking azulfadine along with the nsaid medicines, but the
effects of the combined drugs aren't supposed to be realized for several months.
as a result of the pain, my friend is having problems sleeping. staying in
one position too long is an ordeal. another major contributor to pain is that
tendonitis has now developed (left thumb and hand with numbness at the base of
the palm; bottom of feet; shoulders and outer thighs). the tendonitis is
quite painful yet my friend's doctor has not recommended any form of treatment
to relieve it.
the latest twist is that the doctor has dropped the anti-inflammatories and is
now recommending prednisone. the hope is that the prednisone will relieve some
of the pain from the tendonitis.

what happened to the saturn v plans
despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the saturn v blueprints
have not been lost. they are kept at marshall space flight center on
microfilm.
the problem in re-creating the saturn v is not finding the drawings, it
is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like
guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and vab
have been converted to space shuttle use, so you have no place to launch
from.
by the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify
the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean
sheet design.
why data from space missions isn't immediately available
investigators associated with nasa missions are allowed exclusive access
for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an
opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being
""scooped"" by people uninvolved in the mission. however, nasa frequently
releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early
in a mission.
risks of nuclear (rtg) power sources for space probes
there has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to
block the galileo and ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium
thermal sources being dangerous. numerous studies claim that even in
worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental
reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.
two interesting data points are (1) the may 1968 loss of two snap 19b2
rtgs, which landed intact in the pacific ocean after a nimbus b weather
satellite failed to reach orbit. the fuel was recovered after 5 months
with no release of plutonium. (2) in april 1970, the apollo 13 lunar
module reentered the atmosphere and its snap 27 rtg heat source, which
was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep tonga trench in
the pacific ocean. the corrosion resistant materials of the rtg are
expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10
half-lives of the pu-238 fuel or about 870 years doe 1980 .

impact of the space shuttle on the ozone layer
from time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from
the space shuttle's solid rocket boosters (srbs) are responsible
for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. studies
indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in
absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. the
remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted
study, charles jackman.
the atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the
stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was
organized by dr. michael prather, nasa goddard institute for space
studies. the three groups involved michael prather and maria garcia
(nasa giss), charlie jackman and anne douglass (nasa goddard space
flight center), and malcolm ko and dak sze (atmospheric and
environmental research, inc.). the effort was to look at the effects
of the space shuttle and titan rockets on the stratosphere.
the following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:
industrial sources: 300,000,000 kilograms year
natural sources: 75,000,000 kilograms year
shuttle sources: 725,000 kilograms year
the shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 titan rockets are
launched yearly. thus the launches would add less than 0.25 to the
total stratospheric chlorine sources.
the effect on ozone is minimal: global yearly average total ozone would
be decreased by 0.0065 . this is much less than total ozone variability
associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.
the influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed
by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1 decrease in globally
averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. the influence of the space shuttle and
titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible. the launch
schedule of the space shuttle and titan rockets would need to be
increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about
the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons
do at the present time.

shuttle's impact on the stratosphere , mj prather, mm garcia, ar

how long can a human live unprotected in space
if you don't try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a
minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. holding your
breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to
watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your
eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal
experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no
immediate injury. you do not explode. your blood does not boil. you do
not freeze. you do not instantly lose consciousness.
various minor problems (sunburn, possibly ""the bends"", certainly some mild, reversible, painless swelling of skin and underlying tissue)
start after ten seconds or so. at some point you lose consciousness from
lack of oxygen. injuries accumulate. after perhaps one or two minutes,
you're dying. the limits are not really known.

how the challenger astronauts died
the challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. this is
a well-documented fact; see the rogers commission report, for example.
what looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank
came apart. the forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the
astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the kerwin
team's medical forensic report.
the astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the
water at circa 200mph, and their bodies then spent several weeks
underwater. their remains were recovered, and after the kerwin team
examined them, they were sent off to be buried.
using the shuttle beyond low earth orbit
you can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low earth orbit
because it can't get there. it is big and heavy and does not carry
enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.
furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of
that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in
the immediate vicinity of the earth. the shuttle orbiter is highly
specialized for travel between earth's surface and low orbit. taking it
higher is enormously costly and wasteful. a much better approach would
be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit
spacecraft. yet another concise answer by henry spencer. the ""face on mars""
there really is a big rock on mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid
face. it appears in two different frames of viking orbiter imagery:
35a72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often
published, with the sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70a13
(with the sun 27 degrees from the west).
science writer richard hoagland has championed the idea that the face is
artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an
extraterrestrial civilization. most other analysts concede that the
resemblance is most likely accidental. other viking images show a
smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling kermit the frog elsewhere
on mars. there exists a mars anomalies research society (sorry, don't
know the address) to study the face.
the mars observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution
camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this
question in a few years. in the meantime, speculation about the face is
best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or

next: faq 14 15 - how to become an astronaut"
59850.eml,sci.space,"how to become an astronaut
first the short form, authored by henry spencer, then an official nasa
announcement.
q. how do i become an astronaut?
a. we will assume you mean a nasa astronaut, since it's probably
impossible for a non-russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying
passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have
so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to
win a lottery. becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet
experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you
want to do it anyway. so you want to become a shuttle ""mission
specialist"".
if you aren't a us citizen, become one; that is a must. after that,
the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly
exceeds the supply. nasa's problem is not finding qualified people,
but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.	it is not enough
to be qualified; you must avoid being dis qualified for any reason,
many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.
get a ph.d. specialize in something that involves getting your hands
dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil. forget computer
programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-
seeable future. degree(s) in one field plus work experience in
another seems to be a frequent winner.
be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.	(do not get a
radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows
what sudden pressure changes would do to rked eyes, and long-term
effects are poorly understood. for that matter, avoid any other
significant medical unknowns.) if you can pass a jet-pilot physical,
you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.
practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in
appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying
to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you
are better than hundreds of other applicants. (and, also, that you
will be a credit to nasa after you are hired: public relations is
a significant part of the job, and nasa's image is very prim and
proper.) the image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.
remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,
and security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.
keep your nose clean.
get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby;
experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.
work for nasa; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,
43 were military or nasa employees, and the remaining two were
a nasa consultant and mae jemison (the first black female astronaut).
if you apply from outside nasa and miss, but they offer you a job
at nasa, take it ; sometimes in the past this has meant ""you
do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first"".
think space: they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance
to demonstrate motivation.
keep trying. many astronauts didn't make it the first time.

national aeronautics and space administration
lyndon b. johnson space center
houston, texas
announcement for mission specialist and pilot astronaut candidates astronaut candidate program
the national aeronautics and space administration (nasa) has a need for
pilot astronaut candidates and mission specialist astronaut candidates
to support the space shuttle program. nasa is now accepting on a
continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.
persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be
considered.
all positions are located at the lyndon b. johnson space center in
houston, texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation
program.
space shuttle program description
the numerous successful flights of the space shuttle have demonstrated
that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming
routine. the space shuttle orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in
the earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. it then
returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and
flight crew.
the orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment
and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation
of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials
processing, manufacturing), and other operations. these missions will
eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space
station. the orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher
orbits than can be achieved by the orbiter itself. users of the space
shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include
government agencies and private industries.
the crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,
and three mission specialists. on occasion additional crew members are
assigned. the commander, pilot, and mission specialists are nasa
astronauts.
pilot astronaut
pilot astronauts server as both space shuttle commanders and pilots.
during flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,
crew, mission success and safety in flight. the pilot assists the
commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. in addition, the
pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing
the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other
payload operations.
mission specialist astronaut
mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,
have overall responsibility for the coordination of shuttle operations
in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and
experiment and payload operations. mission specialists are required to
have a detailed knowledge of shuttle systems, as well as detailed
knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and
objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the
experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. mission
specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling
using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific
experimental operations.
astronaut candidate program basic qualification requirements
applicants must meet the following minimum requirements prior to
submitting an application.
mission specialist astronaut candidate:
1. bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering,
biological science, physical science or mathematics. degree must be
followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,
professional experience. an advanced degree is desirable and may be
substituted for part or all of the experience requirement (master's
degree 1 year, doctoral degree 3 years). quality of academic
preparation is important.
2. ability to pass a nasa class ii space physical, which is similar to a
civilian or military class ii flight physical and includes the following
specific standards:
distant visual acuity:
20 150 or better uncorrected,
correctable to 20 20, each eye.
blood pressure:
140 90 measured in sitting position.
3. height between 58.5 and 76 inches.
pilot astronaut candidate:
1. bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering,
biological science, physical science or mathematics. degree must be
followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,
professional experience. an advanced degree is desirable. quality of
academic preparation is important.
2. at least 1000 hours pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. flight
test experience highly desirable.
3. ability to pass a nasa class i space physical which is similar to a
military or civilian class i flight physical and includes the following
specific standards:
distant visual acuity:
20 50 or better uncorrected
correctable to 20 20, each eye.
blood pressure:
140 90 measured in sitting position.
4. height between 64 and 76 inches.
citizenship requirements
applications for the astronaut candidate program must be citizens of
the united states.
note on academic requirements
applicants for the astronaut candidate program must meet the basic
education requirements for nasa engineering and scientific positions --
specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum
in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor's
degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,
biological science, physical science, or mathematics.
the following degree fields, while related to engineering and the
sciences, are not considered qualifying:
- degrees in technology (engineering technology, aviation technology,
medical technology, etc.)
- degrees in psychology (except for clinical psychology, physiological
psychology, or experimental psychology which are qualifying).
- degrees in nursing.
- degrees in social sciences (geography, anthropology, archaeology, etc.)
- degrees in aviation, aviation management or similar fields.
application procedures
civilian
the application package may be obtained by writing to:
nasa johnson space center
astronaut selection office
attn: ahx
houston, tx 77058
civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. when nasa
decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be
given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is
made. applications received after that date will be retained and
considered for the next selection. applicants will be notified annually
of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate
continued interest in being considered for the program. those applicants
who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from
consideration, and their applications will not be retained. after the
preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be
requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as
supervisors and references may be contacted.
active duty military
active duty military personnel must submit applications to their
respective military service and not directly to nasa. application
procedures will be disseminated by each service.
selection
personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required
for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.
once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered
will be notified of the outcome of the process.
selection rosters established through this process may be used for the
selection of additional candidates during a one year period following
their establishment.
general program requirements
selected applicants will be designated astronaut candidates and will be
assigned to the astronaut office at the johnson space center, houston,
texas. the astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and
evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or
scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to
ongoing programs. they will also participate in the basic astronaut
training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills
required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. pilot
astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in nasa aircraft during
their candidate period.
applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does
not insure selection as an astronaut. final selection as an astronaut
will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and
evaluation period. civilian candidates who successfully complete the
training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become
permanent federal employees and will be expected to remain with nasa for
a period of at least five years. civilian candidates who are not
selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within nasa
depending upon agency requirements and manpower constraints at that
time. successful military candidates will be detailed to nasa for a
specified tour of duty.
nasa has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified
minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.
therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.
pay and benefits
civilians
salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the federal
governments general schedule pay scales for grades gs-11 through gs-14,
and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements
and experience.
other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and
participation in group health and life insurance plans.
military
selected military personnel will be detailed to the johnson space center
but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and
other similar military matters.

shuttle operations are discussed in the usenet group sci.space.shuttle,

of the shuttle manifest (launch dates and other information)

official nasa shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news
frequently.
why does the shuttle roll just after liftoff?
the following answer and translation are provided by ken jenks the ""ascent guidance and flight control training manual,"" asc g c 2102,
says:
""during the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is
commanded until an i-loaded v(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower
clearance is achieved. then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)
orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a
negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. other
advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort
maneuver complexity, improved s-band look angles, and crew view of
the horizon. the tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining
downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (meco) target
in second stage.""
this really is a good answer, but it's couched in nasa jargon. i'll try
to interpret.
1)	we wait until the shuttle clears the tower before rolling.
2)	then, we roll the shuttle around so that the angle of attack
between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the
""relative wind"") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line
between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly
negative angle (""a negative q-alpha"").	this causes a little bit of
""downward"" force (toward the belly of the orbiter, or the z
direction) and this force ""alleviates structural loading.""
we have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the
most ""delicate"" part of the vehicle.
3)	the new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more
mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or
to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be
the case if we didn't roll (""performance gain"").
4)	the new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated
flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort
maneuvers, the return to launch site (""decreased abort maneuver
complexity"").
5)	the new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio
antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the s-band radio
antennae on the orbiter (""improved s-band look angles"").
6)	the new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a
helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.
7)	the new attitude orients the shuttle so that the body is
more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east
(usually). this allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity
in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit. remember:
velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.
the shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its
velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.
this all begs the question, ""why isn't the launch pad oriented to give
this nice attitude to begin with? why does the shuttle need to roll to
achieve that attitude?"" the answer is that the pads were leftovers
from the apollo days. the shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one
for the solid rocket motor exhaust, one for the space shuttle main
engine exhaust. (you can see the effects of this on any daytime
launch. the srm exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the ssme exhaust is
fluffy white steam. watch for the difference between the ""top"" orbiter side and the ""bottom"" external tank side of the stack.) the
access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented
basically the same way they were for the saturn v's. (a side note: the
saturn v's also had a roll program. don't ask me why -- i'm a shuttle
guy.)
i checked with a buddy in ascent dynamics.	he added that the ""roll
maneuver"" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.
the roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons
stated. the pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping
the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance. the yaw
component is used to determine the orbital inclination. the total
maneuver is really expressed as a ""quaternion,"" a grad-level-math
concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element
array.
how to receive the nasa tv channel, nasa select
nasa select is broadcast by satellite. if you have access to a satellite
dish, you can find select on satcom f2r, transponder 13, c-band, 72
degrees west longitude, audio 6.8, frequency 3960 mhz. f2r is stationed
over the atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from
california and points west. during events of special interest (e.g.
shuttle missions), select is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite
for these viewers.
if you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry select.
it's worth asking if yours doesn't.
the select schedule is found in the nasa headline news which is
frequently posted to sci.space.news. generally it carries press
conferences, briefings by nasa officials, and live coverage of shuttle
missions and planetary encounters. select has recently begun carrying
much more secondary material (associated with spacelink) when missions
are not being covered.

mariner (venus, mars, mercury flybys and orbiters)
mariner 1, the first u.s. attempt to send a spacecraft to venus, failed
minutes after launch in 1962. the guidance instructions from the ground
stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the
onboard computer took control. however, there turned out to be a bug in
the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the
range safety officer destroyed it. although the bug is sometimes claimed
to have been an incorrect fortran do statement, it was actually a
transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted
from the expression ""r-dot-bar sub n"" (nth smoothed value of derivative
of radius). this error led the software to treat normal minor variations
of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.
mariner 2 became the first successful probe to flyby venus in december
of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that venus is a
very hot (800 degrees fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees f.) world
with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide
(sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).
mariner 3, launched on november 5, 1964, was lost when its protective
shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary
space. unable to collect the sun's energy for power from its solar
panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in
solar orbit. it was intended for a mars flyby with mariner 4.
mariner 4, the sister probe to mariner 3, did reach mars in 1965 and
took the first close-up images of the martian surface (22 in all) as it
flew by the planet. the probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere
much thinner than previously thought. many scientists concluded from
this preliminary scan that mars was a ""dead"" world in both the
geological and biological sense.
mariner 5 was sent to venus in 1967. it reconfirmed the data on that
planet collected five years earlier by mariner 2, plus the information
that venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times
that of earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface
of an ocean.
mariner 6 and 7 were sent to mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work
done by mariner 4 four years earlier. however, they failed to take away
the concept of mars as a ""dead"" planet, first made from the basic
measurements of mariner 4.
mariner 8 ended up in the atlantic ocean in 1971 when the rocket
launcher autopilot failed.
mariner 9, the sister probe to mariner 8, became the first craft to
orbit mars in 1971. it returned information on the red planet that no
other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the martian
surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once
flowed across the planet. the probe also took the first detailed closeup
images of mars' two small moons, phobos and deimos.
mariner 10 used venus as a gravity assist to mercury in 1974. the probe
did return the first close-up images of the venusian atmosphere in
ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,
plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four
earth days. mariner 10 eventually made three flybys of mercury from 1974
to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. the probe revealed
mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than
thought. this would seem to indicate that mercury has an iron core which
makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.
pioneer (moon, sun, venus, jupiter, and saturn flybys and orbiters)
pioneer 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph
the moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide
new information on the area between earth and the moon, including new
data on the van allen radiation belts circling earth. all three craft
had failures with their rocket launchers. pioneer 1 was launched on
october 11, 1958, pioneer 2 on november 8, and pioneer 3 on december 6.
pioneer 4 was a moon probe which missed the moon and became the first
u.s. spacecraft to orbit the sun in 1959. pioneer 5 was originally
designed to flyby venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead
studied the interplanetary environment between venus and earth out to
36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until mariner 2. pioneer 6
through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: pioneer 6, 7,
and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. pioneer e (would
have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.
pioneer 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby jupiter in 1973. pioneer
11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to
study saturn in 1979. both vehicles should continue to function through
1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever
to do so.
pioneer venus 1 (1978) (also known as pioneer venus orbiter, or pioneer
12) burned up in the venusian atmosphere on october 8, 1992. pvo made
the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. pioneer venus
2 (also known as pioneer 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere
in december of 1978. the main spacecraft bus burned up high in the
atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the
surface. though none were expected to survive to the surface, the day
probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before
its batteries failed.
ranger (lunar lander and impact missions)
ranger 1 and 2 were test probes for the ranger lunar impact series. they
were meant for high earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems
left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.
ranger 3, launched on january 26, 1962, was intended to land an
instrument capsule on the surface of the moon, but problems during the
launch caused the probe to miss the moon and head into solar orbit.
ranger 3 did try to take some images of the moon as it flew by, but the
camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.
ranger 4, launched april 23, 1962, had the same purpose as ranger 3, but
suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,
the first u.s. probe to reach the moon, albeit without returning data.
ranger 5, launched october 18, 1962 and similar to ranger 3 and 4, lost
all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the moon
and drifted off into solar orbit.
ranger 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: they were to send
back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact
with the moon. ranger 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras
did not operate. ranger 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first
u.s. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.
lunar orbiter (lunar surface photography)
lunar orbiter 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the moon and image
various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned apollo
missions of 1969-1972. the probes also contributed greatly to our
understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.
all five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were
essentially successful in their missions. they were the first u.s.
probes to orbit the moon. all los were eventually crashed into the lunar
surface to avoid interference with the manned apollo missions.
surveyor (lunar soft landers)
the surveyor series were designed primarily to see if an apollo lunar
module could land on the surface of the moon without sinking into the
soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the moon was covered
in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing
vehicle). surveyor was successful in proving that the lunar surface was
strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.
only surveyor 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. the rest became the
first u.s. probes to soft land on the moon, taking thousands of images
and scooping the soil for analysis. apollo 12 landed 600 feet from
surveyor 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to earth. surveyor 7,
the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored
the tycho crater region in 1968.
viking (mars orbiters and landers)
viking 1 was launched from cape canaveral, florida on august 20, 1975 on
a titan 3e-centaur d1 rocket. the probe went into martian orbit on june
19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of chryse
planitia on july 20, 1976. it soon began its programmed search for
martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes
found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of
its surroundings. one thing scientists learned was that mars' sky was
pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is
pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the
thin atmosphere). the lander set down among a field of red sand and
boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.
the viking 1 orbiter kept functioning until august 7, 1980, when it ran
out of attitude-control propellant. the lander was switched into a
weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep
functioning through 1994; but after november 13, 1982, an errant command
had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until
further orders. communication was never regained again, despite the
engineers' efforts through may of 1983.
an interesting side note: viking 1's lander has been designated the
thomas a. mutch memorial station in honor of the late leader of the
lander imaging team. the national air and space museum in washington,
d.c. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the mutch station plaque until
it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.
viking 2 was launched on september 9, 1975, and arrived in martian orbit
on august 7, 1976. the lander touched down on september 3, 1976 in
utopia planitia. it accomplished essentially the same tasks as its
sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording
one marsquake. the orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in
1978, which prompted it being shut down that july. the lander was shut
down on april 12, 1980.
the orbits of both viking orbiters should decay around 2025.
voyager (outer planet flybys)
voyager 1 was launched september 5, 1977, and flew past jupiter on march
5, 1979 and by saturn on november 13, 1980. voyager 2 was launched
august 20, 1977 (before voyager 1), and flew by jupiter on august 7,
1979, by saturn on august 26, 1981, by uranus on january 24, 1986, and
by neptune on august 8, 1989. voyager 2 took advantage of a rare
once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to
outer planet. voyager 1 could, in principle, have headed towards pluto,
but jpl opted for the sure thing of a titan close up.
between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their
satellites, and their rings has become immense. voyager 1 2 discovered
that jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and
aurorae. three new satellites were discovered. two of the major
surprises were that jupiter has rings and that io has active sulfurous
volcanoes, with major effects on the jovian magnetosphere.
when the two probes reached saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets
and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep
the rings stable. the weather was tame compared with jupiter: massive
jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot band cycle
is known). titan's atmosphere was smoggy. mimas' appearance was
startling: one massive impact crater gave it the death star appearance.
the big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. braids,
kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.
voyager 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,
continued the mission to uranus and neptune. uranus itself was highly
monochromatic in appearance. one oddity was that its magnetic axis was
found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational
axis, giving uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. icy channels were found on
ariel, and miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10
satellites and one more ring were discovered.
in contrast to uranus, neptune was found to have rather active weather,
including numerous cloud features. the ring arcs turned out to be bright
patches on one ring. two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were
discovered. neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. triton had a
canteloupe appearance and geysers. (what's liquid at 38k?)
the two voyagers are expected to last for about two more decades. their
on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets
beyond pluto. their next major scientific discovery should be the
location of the heliopause.
soviet planetary missions
since there have been so many soviet probes to the moon, venus, and
mars, i will highlight only the primary missions:
soviet lunar probes
luna 1 - lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed moon and became first
craft in solar orbit.
luna 2 - first craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.
luna 3 - took first images of lunar farside in 1959.
zond 3 - took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since luna 3. was
also a test for future mars missions.
luna 9 - first probe to soft land on the moon in 1966, returned images
from surface.
luna 10 - first probe to orbit the moon in 1966.
luna 13 - second successful soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.
zond 5 - first successful circumlunar craft. zond 6 through 8
accomplished similar missions through 1970. the probes were
unmanned tests of a manned orbiting soyuz-type lunar vehicle.
luna 16 - first probe to land on moon and return samples of lunar soil
to earth in 1970. luna 20 accomplished similar mission in
1972.
luna 17 - delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the moon's
surface, lunokhod 1, in 1970. a similar feat was accomplished
with luna 21 lunokhod 2 in 1973.
luna 24 - last soviet lunar mission to date. returned soil samples in
1976.
soviet venus probes
venera 1 - first acknowledged attempt at venus mission. transmissions
lost enroute in 1961.
venera 2 - attempt to image venus during flyby mission in tandem with
venera 3. probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in
february of 1966. no images were returned.
venera 3 - attempt to place a lander capsule on venusian surface.
transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe
became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.
venera 4 - first probe to successfully return data while descending
through venusian atmosphere. crushed by air pressure before
reaching surface in 1967. venera 5 and 6 mission profiles
similar in 1969.
venera 7 - first probe to return data from the surface of another planet
in 1970. venera 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in
1972.
venera 9 - sent first image of venusian surface in 1975. was also the
first probe to orbit venus. venera 10 accomplished similar
mission.
venera 13 - returned first color images of venusian surface in 1982.
venera 14 accomplished similar mission.
venera 15 - accomplished radar mapping with venera 16 of sections of
planet's surface in 1983 more detailed than pvo.
vega 1 - accomplished with vega 2 first balloon probes of venusian
atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. flyby buses went on
to become first spacecraft to study comet halley close-up in
march of 1986.
soviet mars probes
mars 1 - first acknowledged mars probe in 1962. transmissions ceased
enroute the following year.
zond 2 - first possible attempt to place a lander capsule on martian
surface. probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.
mars 2 - first soviet mars probe to land - albeit crash - on martian
surface. orbiter section first soviet probe to circle the red
planet in 1971.
mars 3 - first successful soft landing on martian surface, but lander
signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.
mars 4 - attempt at orbiting mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to
fire, probe went on into solar orbit.
mars 5 - first fully successful soviet mars mission, orbiting mars in
1974. returned images of martian surface comparable to u.s.
probe mariner 9.
mars 6 - landing attempt in 1974. lander crashed into the surface.
mars 7 - lander missed mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit
with its flyby bus.
phobos 1 - first attempt to land probes on surface of mars' largest
moon, phobos. probe failed enroute in 1988 due to
human computer error.
phobos 2 - attempt to land probes on martian moon phobos. the probe did
enter mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week
before scheduled phobos landing.
while there has been talk of soviet jupiter, saturn, and even
interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have
yet been taken with these projects. more intensive studies of the moon,
mars, venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a
mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been
planned for 2003. how the many changes in the former soviet union (now
the commonwealth of independent states) will affect the future of their
space program remains to be seen.
japanese planetary missions
sakigake (ms-t5) was launched from the kagoshima space center by isas on
january 8 1985, and approached halley's comet within about 7 million km
on march 11, 1986. the spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to
measure interplanetary magnetic field plasma waves solar wind, all of
which work normally now, so isas made an earth swingby by sakigake on
january 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. the closest
approach was at 23h08m47s (jst utc 9h) on january 8, 1992. the
geocentric distance was 88,997 km. this is the first planet-swingby for
a japanese spacecraft.
during the approach, sakigake observed the geotail. some geotail
passages will be scheduled in some years hence. the second earth-swingby
will be on june 14, 1993 (at 40 re (earth's radius)), and the third
october 28, 1994 (at 86 re).
hiten, a small lunar probe, was launched into earth orbit on january 24,
1990. the spacecraft was then known as muses-a, but was renamed to hiten
once in orbit. the 430 lb probe looped out from earth and made its first
lunary flyby on march 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget
satellite, hagoromo. japan at this point became the third nation to
orbit a satellite around the moon, joining the unites states and ussr.
the smaller spacecraft, hagoromo, remained in orbit around the moon. an
apparently broken transistor radio caused the japanese space scientists
to lose track of it. hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on march
19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. the
rocket firing of hagoromo was optically confirmed using the schmidt
camera (105-cm, f3.1) at the kiso observatory in japan.
hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and
performed aerobraking experiments using the earth's atmosphere. hiten
made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 jst (utc 9h) on february 15,
1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3n, 9.7e) and
fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into
lunar orbit. the following is the orbital calculation results after the
approach:
apoapsis altitude: about 49,400 km
periapsis altitude: about 9,600 km
inclination	: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)
period : 4.7 days
planetary mission references
i also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three
groups: general overviews, specific books on particular space missions,
and periodical sources on space probes. this list is by no means
complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your
research through generally available works on the subject. if anyone can
add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.
though naturally i recommend all the books listed below, i think it
would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in
order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in
this area. i also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date
general works on astronomy and the sol system, to give you some extra
background. most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good
public and university library. some of the more recently published works
can also be purchased in and or ordered through any good mass- market
bookstore.

other works and periodicals:
nasa has published very detailed and technical books on every space
probe mission it has launched. good university libraries will carry
these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission
you wish to read about. i recommend these works after you first study
some of the books listed above.
some periodicals i recommend for reading on space probes are national
geographic, which has written articles on the pioneer probes to earth's
moon luna and the jovian planets jupiter and saturn, the ranger,
surveyor, lunar orbiter, and apollo missions to luna, the mariner
missions to mercury, venus, and mars, the viking probes to mars, and the
voyager missions to jupiter, saturn, uranus, and neptune.
more details on american, soviet, european, and japanese probe missions
can be found in sky and telescope, astronomy, science, nature, and
scientific american magazines. time, newsweek, and various major
newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,
but also show you what else was going on with earth at the time events
were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. space missions are
affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you
probably know.
depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you
might also wish to join the planetary society, one of the largest space
groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. their
periodical, the planetary report, details the latest space probe
missions. write to the planetary society, 65 north catalina avenue,
pasadena, california 91106 usa.
good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. i
personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas
in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from
it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

many space activities center around large government or international
bureaucracies.	in the us that means nasa. if you have basic information
requests: (e.g., general pr info, research grants, data, limited tours, and
especially summer employment (typically resumes should be ready by jan. 1),
etc.), consider contacting the nearest nasa center to answer your questions.
email typically will not get you any where, computers are used by
investigators, not pr people. the typical volume of mail per center is a
multiple of 10,000 letters a day. seek the public information office at one
of the below, this is their job:
nasa (the national aeronautics and space administration) is the
civilian space agency of of the united states federal government.
it reports directly to the white house and is not a cabinet
post such as the military department of defense. its 20k employees
are civil servants and hence us citizens. another 100k contractors
also work for nasa.

images, probe navigation, and other info about unmanned exploration,
this is the place to go.
jpl is run under contract for nasa by the nearby california
institute of technology, unlike the nasa centers above. this
distinction is subtle but critical. jpl has different requirements
for unsolicited research proposals and summer hires. for instance in
the latter, an sf 171 is useless. employees are caltech employees,
contractors, and for the most part have similar responsibilities.

next: faq 9 15 - schedules for space missions, and how to see them"
59909.eml,sci.space,"upcoming planetary probes - missions and schedules
information on upcoming or currently active missions not mentioned below
would be welcome. sources: nasa fact sheets, cassini mission design
team, isas nasda launch schedules, press kits.
asuka (astro-d) - isas (japan) x-ray astronomy satellite, launched into
earth orbit on 2 20 93. equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20
angstrom) x-ray telescope, x-ray ccd cameras, and imaging gas
scintillation proportional counters.
cassini - saturn orbiter and titan atmosphere probe. cassini is a joint
nasa esa project designed to accomplish an exploration of the saturnian
system with its cassini saturn orbiter and huygens titan probe. cassini
is scheduled for launch aboard a titan iv centaur in october of 1997.
after gravity assists of venus, earth and jupiter in a vvejga
trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at saturn in june of 2004. upon
arrival, the cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an
orbit around saturn. near the end of this initial orbit, the huygens
probe separates from the orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of
titan. the orbiter relays the probe data to earth for about 3 hours
while the probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the
surface. after the completion of the probe mission, the orbiter
continues touring the saturnian system for three and a half years. titan
synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of titan and
targeted flybys of iapetus, dione and enceladus. the objectives of the
mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of saturn's atmosphere,
rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of saturn's
satellites, and characterize titan's atmosphere and surface.
one of the most intriguing aspects of titan is the possibility that its
surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that
result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. these
hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain
down onto the surface. the cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to
peer through titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the
surface. experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will
investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.
the cassini mission is named for jean dominique cassini (1625-1712), the
first director of the paris observatory, who discovered several of
saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. the titan
atmospheric entry probe is named for the dutch physicist christiaan
huygens (1629-1695), who discovered titan and first described the true
nature of saturn's rings.

jupiter. efforts to unfurl the stuck high-gain antenna (hga) have
essentially been abandoned. jpl has developed a backup plan using data
compression (jpeg-like for images, lossless compression for data from
the other instruments) which should allow the mission to achieve
approximately 70 of its original objectives.

hiten - japanese (isas) lunar probe launched 1 24 90. has made
multiple lunar flybys. released hagoromo, a smaller satellite,
into lunar orbit. this mission made japan the third nation to
orbit a satellite around the moon.
magellan - venus radar mapping mission. has mapped almost the entire
surface at high resolution. currently (4 93) collecting a global gravity
map.
mars observer - mars orbiter including 1.5 m pixel resolution camera.
launched 9 25 92 on a titan iii tos booster. mo is currently (4 93) in
transit to mars, arriving on 8 24 93. operations will start 11 93 for
one martian year (687 days).
topex poseidon - joint us french earth observing satellite, launched
8 10 92 on an ariane 4 booster. the primary objective of the
topex poseidon project is to make precise and accurate global
observations of the sea level for several years, substantially
increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. the satellite also
will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.
ulysses- european space agency probe to study the sun from an orbit over
its poles. launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields
experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for
various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.
since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send ulysses far out of
the ecliptic plane, it went to jupiter instead, and stole energy from
that planet by sliding over jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist
manuver in february 1992. this bent its path into a solar orbit tilted
about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. it will pass over the sun's south pole
in the summer of 1993. its aphelion is 5.2 au, and, surprisingly, its
perihelion is about 1.5 au-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft
that's always further from the sun than the earth is!
while in jupiter's neigborhood, ulysses studied the magnetic and
radiation environment. for a short summary of these results, see science , v. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 september 1992). for gory technical
detail, see the many articles in the same issue.

proposed missions:
o advanced x-ray astronomy facility (axaf)
possible launch from shuttle in 1995, axaf is a space
observatory with a high resolution telescope. it would orbit for
15 years and study the mysteries and fate of the universe.
o earth observing system (eos)
possible launch in 1997, 1 of 6 us orbiting space platforms to
provide long-term data (15 years) of earth systems science
including planetary evolution.
o mercury observer
possible 1997 launch.
o lunar observer
possible 1997 launch, would be sent into a long-term lunar
orbit. the observer, from 60 miles above the moon's poles, would
survey characteristics to provide a global context for the
results from the apollo program.
o space infrared telescope facility
possible launch by shuttle in 1999, this is the 4th element of
the great observatories program. a free-flying observatory with
a lifetime of 5 to 10 years, it would observe new comets and
other primitive bodies in the outer solar system, study cosmic
birth formation of galaxies, stars and planets and distant
infrared-emitting galaxies
o mars rover sample return (mrsr)
robotics rover would return samples of mars' atmosphere and
surface to earch for analysis. possible launch dates: 1996 for
imaging orbiter, 2001 for rover.
o fire and ice
possible launch in 2001, will use a gravity assist flyby of
earth in 2003, and use a final gravity assist from jupiter in
2005, where the probe will split into its fire and ice
components: the fire probe will journey into the sun, taking
measurements of our star's upper atmosphere until it is
vaporized by the intense heat. the ice probe will head out
towards pluto, reaching the tiny world for study by 2016.

gravity of the target body. this scaling is
cited for lunar craters and may hold true for
other bodies.

rock on the continental shields.
c : crater collapse factor, 1 for craters 3 km
in diameter, 1.3 for larger craters (on earth).

w pi d delta v (12 4.185 10 )
: projectile kinetic energy in kt tnt equivalent
given diameter d, velocity v, and projectile
density delta in cgs units. delta of around 3
g cm 3 is fairly good for an asteroid.
an rms velocity of v 20 km sec may be used for earth-crossing
asteroids.
under these assumptions, the body which created the barringer meteor
crater in arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in
diameter.
more generally, one can use (after gehrels, 1985):
asteroid number of objects impact probability impact energy
diameter (km) (impacts year) ( 5 10 20 ergs)
10 10 10 -8 10 9
1 1 000 10 -6 10 6
0.1 100 000 10 -4 10 3
assuming simple scaling laws. note that 5 10 20 ergs 13 000 tons tnt
equivalent, or the energy released by the hiroshima a-bomb.

cunningham, c.j. 1988 introduction to asteroids: the next frontier (richmond: willman-bell, inc.) covers all aspects of asteroid
studies and is an excellent introduction to the subject for people
of all experience levels. it also has a very extensive reference
list covering essentially all of the reference material in the
field. map projections and spherical trignometry
two easy-to-find sources of map projections are the ""encyclopaedia
brittanica"", (particularly the older volumes) and a tutorial appearing
in graphics gems (academic press, 1990). the latter was written with
simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind
(spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).
more than you ever cared to know about map projections is in john
snyder's usgs publication ""map projections--a working manual"", usgs
professional paper 1395. this contains detailed descriptions of 32
projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both
spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. it's a
neat book, all 382 pages worth. this one's 20.
you might also want the companion volume, by snyder and philip voxland,
""an album of map projections"", usgs professional paper 1453. this
contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. formulas are
in the back, example plots in the front. 14, 250 pages.
you can order these 2 ways. the cheap, slow way is direct from usgs:
earth science information center, us geological survey, 507 national
center, reston, va 22092. (800)-usa-maps. they can quote you a price and
tell you where to send your money. expect a 6-8 week turnaround time.
a much faster way (about 1 week) is through timely discount topos,
(303)-469-5022, 9769 w. 119th drive, suite 9, broomfield, co 80021. call
them and tell them what you want. they'll quote a price, you send a
check, and then they go to usgs customer service counter and pick it up
for you. add about a 3-4 service charge, plus shipping.
a (perhaps more accessible) mapping article is:
r. miller and f. reddy, ""mapping the world in pascal"",
byte v12 14, december 1987
contains turbo pascal procedures for five common map projections. a
demo program, cartog.pas, and a small (6,000 point) coastline data
is available on compuserve, genie, and many bbss.

moffett field, ca 94035-1000 three-dimensional star galaxy coordinates
to generate 3d coordinates of astronomical objects, first obtain an
astronomical database which specifies right ascension, declination, and
parallax for the objects. convert parallax into distance using the
formula in part 6 of the faq, convert ra and declination to coordinates
on a unit sphere (see some of the references on planetary positions and
spherical trignometry earlier in this section for details on this), and
scale this by the distance.
two databases useful for this purpose are the yale bright star catalog
(sources listed in faq section 3) or ""the catalogue of stars within 25
parsecs of the sun"" (in pub space faq stars.data and stars.doc on
ames.arc.nasa.gov).

60103.eml,sci.space,"acronym list for sci.astro, sci.space, and sci.space.shuttle:
edition 8, 1992 dec 7
last posted: 1992 aug 27
this list is offered as a reference for translating commonly appearing
acronyms in the space-related newsgroups. if i forgot or botched your
favorite acronym, please let me know! also, if there's an acronym not on this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if i can figure
it out, i'll add it to the list.
note that this is intended to be a reference for frequently seen acronyms, and is most emphatically not encyclopedic. if i incorporated
every acronym i ever saw, i'd soon run out of disk space! :-)
the list will be posted at regular intervals, every 30 days. all
comments regarding it are welcome; i'm reachable as note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you're on your
own for figuring out what they mean ! note also that the total number of
acronyms in use far exceeds what i can list; special-purpose acronyms that
are essentially always explained as they're introduced are omitted.
further, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of edition 3 of
the list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they're simply
different ways of referring to the same thing.
thanks to everybody who's sent suggestions since the first version of
the list, and especially to garrett a. wollman who is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose in
character than mine, and to daniel fischer who is maintaining a truly huge list (535 at last count) of acronyms and
terms, mostly in german (which i read, fortunately).
special thanks this time to ken hollis at nasa, who sent me a copy of nasa
reference publication 1059 revised: space transportation system and
associated payloads: glossary, acronyms, and abbreviations , a truly
mammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of tlas.
special bonus! at the end of this posting, you will find a perl program
written by none other than larry wall, whose purpose is to scramble the
acronym list in an entertaining fashion. thanks, larry!

60151.eml,sci.space,"the problem with commercial titan is that mm has made little or no attempt
to market it. they're basically happy with their government business and
don't want to have to learn how to sell commercially.
a secondary problem is that it is a bit big. they'd need to go after
multi-satellite launches, a la ariane, and that complicates the marketing
task quite significantly.
they also had some problems with launch facilities at just the wrong time
to get them started properly. if memory serves, the pad used for the mars
observer launch had just come out of heavy refurbishment work that had
prevented launches from it for a year or so.
there have been a few ct launches. mars observer was one of them. so
was that stranded intelsat, and at least one of its brothers that reached
orbit properly.
all work is one man's work. henry spencer u of toronto zoology

i seem to recall, somebody built or at least proposed a wasp waisetd
passenger civil transport. i thought it was a 727, but maybe it
was a dc- 8,9??? sure it had a funny passenger compartment,
but on the other hand it seemed to save fuel.
i thought area rules applied even before transonic speeds, just
not as badly.

60155.eml,sci.space,"i hate to pour cold water on this, but currently seawater extracted
uranium, even using the new, improved fiber absorbers from japan, is
about 20 times more expensive than uranium on the spot market.
uranium is very cheap right now, around 10 lb. right now, there
are mines closing because they can't compete with places like cigar
lake in canada (where the ore is so rich they present safety hazards
to the mines, who work in shielded vehicles). plenty of other sources
(for example, uranium from phosphate processing) would come on line before
uranium reached 200 lb.
""demand and supply balance will collapse"" is nonsense. supply and

60187.eml,sci.space,"1 microgravity vacuum process research 2 life sciences research (adaptation to space) 3 spacecraft maintenence
the old nasa approach, explified by shuttle and ssf so far, was to
centralize functionality. these projects failed to meet
their targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users
took most of their payloads off shuttle after wasting much effort to
tie their payloads to it, and ssf has crumbled into disorganization
and miscommunication. over 50 billion has been spent on these
two projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement
in commercial space industrialization. meanwhile, military and commercial
users have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the
constellation.
firstly, different functions are broken down into different
constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:
thus we have the gps navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,
comsats in clarke and molniya orbits, etc. secondly, the task
is distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,
providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed.
ssf's 3 main functions require quite different environments
and are also prime candidates for constellization. 1 we have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:
comet and mir for long-duration flights, shuttle spacelab for
short-duration flights. the best strategy for this area is
inexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of u.s. facilities
on mir, shuttle mir linkup, and transition from shuttle spacelab
to a much less expensive ssto spacehab comet or ssto sif comet.
we might also expand the research program to take advantage of
interesting space environments, eg the high-radiation van allen belt
or gas plasma gradients in comet tails. the comet system can
be much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a
station is too large to affordably launch beyond leo. 2 we need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,
but also in lunar and martian gravities, and in the radiation
environments of deep space instead of the protected shelter
of leo. this is a very long-term, low-priority project, since
astronauts will have little practical use in the space program
until costs come down orders of magnitude. furthermore, using
astronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,
and the sample size. so i propose labratsat, a constellation
tether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity
in super-van-allen-belt orbits that are representative of the
radiation environment encountered on earth-moon, earth-mars,
earth-asteroid, etc. trips. the miniaturized life support
machinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a vr
interface. after several orbital missions have been flown,
follow-ons can act as ldefs on the lunar and martian surface,
testing out the actual environment at low cost before billions
are spent on astronauts. 3 by far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in
clarke orbit. i propose a fleet of small teleoperated
robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can
practice their skills. once in place, robots can pry stuck
solar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,
inject fuel, etc. once the fleet is working, it can be
spun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat
companies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.
by applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting
rid of the failed centralized strategy of sts and old ssf, we
have radically improved the capability of the program while
greatly cutting its cost. for a fraction of ssf's pricetag,
we can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study
life's adaptation to a much large more representative variety
of space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum
research inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose
orbits.
n.b., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration
as well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.
mars network and artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously
we can set up a network of native propellant plants on mars that can be used
to fuel planet-wide rover ballistic hopper prospecting and
sample return. the descendants of labratsat's technology can
be used as a mars surface ldef and to test out closed-ecology
greenhouses on mars at low cost.

trash that will have to be run through it as opposed to the costs of
separating things first and having a different 'run' for each

something like this, as opposed to what kind of energy you would
really recover as opposed to what it would cost to build and power

universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. aert jansz, de eerste
waarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de utrechtse sterrenkunde
in de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de
voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. dit jaar is het 350
jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.
de huidige generatie utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten
sterrenkunde, verenigd in het sterrekundig instituut utrecht,
vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala
aan feestelijke activiteiten. zo is er voor scholieren een
planetenproject, programmeert de studium generale een aantal
voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de dies
natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. er
staat echter meer op stapel.
studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een
sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. de onderwerpen van het
symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het
huidige utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten
'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren.
bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de
deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van
de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. in de
eerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. lamers een
beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren,
waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een
half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten
zullen ingaan. na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot
het stellen van vragen. het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op
een apart vel.
het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars
studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. ook andere belangstellenden
zijn van harte welkom!
tijdens de lezing van prof. kuijpers zullen, als alles goed
gaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de radiosterrenwacht
westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen
het heelal, westerbork en utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van
een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar,
in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren.
prof. kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel
opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en
trachten te verklaren.
het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de
technische haalbaarheid ervan. de op te vangen signalen zijn
namelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10
miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30
watt een seconde te laten branden! tijdens het symposium zal
er niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse
technologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.

60207.eml,sci.space,"every aircraft has flight constraints for speed aoa power. when
graphed, these define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft,
presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the
area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft
doesn't fall out of the sky. hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes
'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational)
envelope'.
note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actually
flies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there are
are the theoretical predictions. hence, one of the things test pilots
do for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close the
correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- in
essence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to where
the airplane actually starts to fail to fly. note, too, that this is
done is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally
carefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and how
far is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans,
such as the 'early' first flight of the f-16 during its high-speed
taxi tests).

space news, april 5-11, 1993, p.2 excerpts russia launched its first ocean reconnaissance satellite in 26 months
march 30, confounding western analysts who had proclaimed the program dead.
the itar-tass news agency announced the launch of cosmos 2238 from
plesetsk cosmodrome, but provided little description of the payload's mission.
however, based on the satellite's trajectory, western observers
identified it as a military spacecraft designed to monitor electronic

the satellite carries scientific apparatus for continuing space research.
the satellite has been placed in an orbit with the following parameters:
initial period of revolution--92.8 minutes; apogee--443 km; perigee--413 km;
orbital inclination--65 degrees.
besides scientific apparatus the satellite carries a radio system for the

60215.eml,sci.space,"after receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of ssto,
i called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local senator (d) patty
murray, washington state. i started asking for an hour, and when i heard
the gasp on the end of the phone, i quickly backed off to 1 2 an hour.
later in that conversation, i learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.
we got the standard bozo treatment. that is, we were called back by an aide,
who scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not
bozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to
make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.
well, i got allocated 1 2 hour with sen. murrays aide, and we ended up talking
to him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.
we covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was dcx specific.
most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer. there was another
woman there who took copius quantities of notes on every topic that
we brought up.
but, with murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate
aligned (i.e. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.
so, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to
leo. solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming
feasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.
we hit the tourism angle, and i left a copy of the patric collins tourism
paper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the
atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after seeing the smog
over l.a. we hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is
more pronounced in space, and said that that had potential to lead to
understanding of, and maybe a cure for osteoporosis. we hit the education
whereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that
they havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other
fields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday
would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.
we hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business
angle. we hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal
communicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc... jobs provided
in those sectors.
jobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..
we mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.
we left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order
to make this even easier to do. and he asked questions on this point.
we ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are
proceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the
results from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),
and most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along
the lines of lowering the cost to leo.
in the middle we also gave a little speal about the lunar resource data
purchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was very interested in it.
he asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,
and contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually
happen immediatly there.
the last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we
knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they
could feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know
the answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who
really did know the answers.
then finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself. he
said that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this
would be something that she would be very interested in, although they
do have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the
state 1 week out of 6 these days.
all in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.

60220.eml,sci.space,"the sightings were apparently spurious. there is no planet inside of
the orbit of mercury.
the idea of vulcan came from the differences between mercury's observed
perihelion precession and the value it should have had according to
newtonian physics. leverrier made an extensive set of observations
and calculations during the mid 19th century, and simon newcombe later
improved on the observations and re-calculated using leverrier's system
of equations. now leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of neptune
and since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit
of uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was
afoot with mercury.
but alas, 'twere not so. mercury's perihelion precesses at the rate
it does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly
curved due to the sun's mass. this explanation had to wait until 1915
and albert einstein's synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics
of moving bodies (commonly called special relativity) with reimanian
geometry. the result was the general theory of relativity, and one of
it's most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession
of mercury's perihelion almost exactly. (exactly if you use newcomb's
numbers rather than leverrier's.)
of course not everybody believes einstein, and that's fine. but subsequent
efforts to find any planets closer to the sun than mercury using radar
have been fruitless.

60224.eml,sci.space,"i am sure mary or henry can describe this more aptly then me.
but here is how i understand it.
at speed, near supersonic. the wind behaves like a fluid pipe.
it becomes incompressible. so wind has to bend away from the
wing edges. as the wing thickens, the more the pipes bend.
if they have no place to go, they begin to stall, and force
compression, stealing power from the vehicle (high drag).
if you squeeze the fuselage, so that these pipes have aplace to bend
into, then drag is reduced.
essentially, teh cross sectional area of the aircraft shoulf
remain constant for all areas of the fuselage. that is where the wings are

60229.eml,sci.space,"gibbons outlines space station redesign guidance
dr. john h. gibbons, director, office of science and
technology policy, outlined to the members-designate of
the advisory committee on the redesign of the space
station on april 3, three budget options as guidance to
the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of
the space station.
a low option of 5 billion, a mid-range option of 7
billion and a high option of 9 billion will be
considered by the committee. each option would cover
the total expenditures for space station from fiscal
year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for
development, operations, utilization, shuttle
integration, facilities, research operations support,
transition cost and also must include adequate program
reserves to insure program implementation within the
available funds.
over the next 5 years, 4 billion is reserved within
the nasa budget for the president's new technology
investment. as a result, station options above 7
billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in
the rest of the nasa budget. for example, a space
station option of 9 billion would require 2 billion
in offsets from the nasa budget over the next 5 years.
gibbons presented the information at an organizational
session of the advisory committee. generally, the
members-designate focused upon administrative topics
and used the session to get acquainted. they also
received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation
on the process the station redesign team is following
to develop options for the advisory committee to
consider.
gibbons also announced that the united states and its
international partners -- the europeans, japanese, and
canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give
""full consideration"" to use of russian assets in the
course of the space station redesign process.
to that end, the russians will be asked to participate
in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting
basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their
expertise in assessing the capabilities of mir and the
possible use of mir and other russian capabilities and
systems. the u.s. and international partners hope to
benefit from the expertise of the russian participants
in assessing russian systems and technology. the
overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop
options for reducing station costs while preserving key
research and exploration capabilities. careful
integration of russian assets could be a key factor in
achieving that goal.
gibbons reiterated that, ""president clinton is
committed to the redesigned space station and to making
every effort to preserve the science, the technology
and the jobs that the space station program represents.
however, he also is committed to a space station that
is well managed and one that does not consume the
national resources which should be used to invest in
the future of this industry and this nation.""

participation will be accomplished through the east-

were going to be funded. i don't remember his name or title off hand
and i have discarded the colloquia announcement. in any case, he was
asked about that very matter: ""why can't we spend a few million more
to keep instruments that we already have in place going?""
his responce was that there are only so many available to him and
the lead time on an instrument like a cobe, magellan, hubble, etc
is 5-10 years minumum. if he spent all that could be spent on using
current instruments in the current budget enviroment he would have
very little to nothing for future projects. if he did that, sure
in the short run the science would be wonderful and he would be popular,
however starting a few years after he had retired he would become
one of the greatest villans ever seen in the space community for not
funding the early stages of the next generation of instruments. just
as he had benefited from his predicessor's funding choices, he owed it
to whoever his sucessor would eventually be to keep developing new
missions, even at the expense of cutting off some instruments before

of the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has
formed to look at three options ssf derivative larc,
modular buildup with bus-1 msfc, and single launch
core ""wingless orbiter"" jsc. later, in response to
a reporters question, i thought i heard o'connor say
the option based on a ssf redesign was a ""moderate""
cost option, in between low high cost options. not
the ""high cost"" option as sawyer wrote).
the article goes on to describe the other two options
as ""one features modules that could gradually be fitted
together in orbit, similar to the russian mir. the
other is a core facility that could be deposited in
orbit in a single launch, like skylab. that option
would use existing hardware from the space shuttle -
the fuselage, for example, in its basic structure.""
the last sentence in the article contradicts the title the first paragraph. the sentence reads ""he o'connor said a streamlined version of the planned
space station freedom is still possible within the
administration's budget guidelines."""

60241.eml,sci.space,"my dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. a couple
of weeks ago, when i first read this in your posting, i
talked with one of the cost experts here in space station
at headquarters if you wondering why i didn't post a
response immediately, i do have a real job i'm supposed
to be doing here at headquarters, digging up old 20 khz
data looking into sherzer kyger claims rates pretty low
on the totem pole of priority. also, i spent last weekend
in kansas city, at the national science teachers
association conference, extolling the virtues of ssf
to 15,000 science teachers. first off, yes, the concept of 'center tax', or 'wrap' does
exist. if i recall the numbers correctly, the total 'tax'
for the ssf program for this fiscal year is around 40 million.
this was computed by adding up the wp-1, wp-2, and wp-4
center 'taxes'. with the ssf budget for this fiscal year at 2.2 billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is
04 2.2 1.8 over the life of the ssf program, using your figure of 30
billion for the cost of ssf, a tax at a 1.8 rate comes to 540 million. this is alot less than 10 billion, but i
will concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocket
change.
i should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1 3 could
be close to the actual rate. the tax is only charged on funds
that are spent at the center (kind of like mcdonalds at some
states, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat
the food at the restaurant, but you don't if you get it
take-out). for example, at wp-4, the vast bulk of the funds
we receive go to the rocketdyne contract, and are not subject to the center tax (i don't have the numbers in
front of me, but i'd guess at least 95 of the wp-4 funds
go to rocketdyne). so, you could be right about a tax
rate of 1 3, but it's only applied to funds spent at the
center, and not to the prime contracts.
this leads to the obvious question ""what is the government
doing with ssf funds that don't go to the prime contractors?
(i.e. ok, wp-4 gets a slice of the 30 billion pie. a
big portion of this slice goes to rocketdyne. what happens
to the balance of the funds, which aren't eaten
up by the center tax?)""
at wp-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting
development funds (as they are supporting the development
work done by rocketdyne). we have used these funds to
setup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical
power system architecture. our testbed has a real life
solar array field (left over from solar cell research
research a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries
(to simulate the nickel-hydrogen batteries on ssf), dc
switchgear, dc-dc converter units, and simulated
loads. data from the testbed was used in a recent
change evaluation involving concerns about the stability
of the power system.
we have also used the supporting development money to
purchase nickel hydrogen batteries, which are on life
testing at both lewis and the crane naval facility in
indiana. as a side point, 6 of the battery cells on
test recently hit the four year life test milestone.
38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the
on-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).
as a final example, my 'home' division at lewis used
the supporting development funds to purchase personal
computers and work stations, for performing system
analyses (like modeling of the performance of the
electrical power system, availability calculations
using a monte-carlo simulation, setting up a
database with information on weight of the power
system elements).
finally, the money raised by the 'tax' does not all
go into a 'slush fund.' at lewis, the director
does control a small discretionary fund. each year,
any individual at lewis can submit a proposal to
the director to get money from this fund to look
at pretty much anything within the lewis charter.
most of the tax, however, goes to fund the 'general'
services at the center, like the library, the
central computer services division, the contractor
who removes the snow, etc. thus, it is rather
difficult to determine what percentage of the
ssf budget doesn't go for ssf activities. to get
an accurate figure, you would have to take
the annual expenditure for the library (for example),
and then divide by the amount of the library funds
used to support ssf (which would be hard to
compute by itself - how would you figure out
what percentage of the bill for aviation week for
1 year is 'billable' to ssf, would you base it on
the person-hours ssf employees spend reading av-week
versus the rest of the center personnel). you would
then have to compare this estimate of the ssf
portion of the library expense with the portion of
the tax that goes to support the library. who knows,
maybe ssf overpays on the tax to run the library, but
we underpay for snow removal? talk about
a burecratic nightmare!
my last point is that i can't believe your claim that
congress has never heard of the term 'center tax.'
unfortunately, all of the nasa testimony before
congress isn't on a computer, so i can't do a simple
word search someplace to prove you wrong. but surely,
in some gao audit somewhere, these nasa cost methods
were documented for congress?"
60242.eml,sci.space,"huntington beach, calif. -- on a picture-perfect southern
california day, mcdonnell douglas rolled out its dc-x rocket ship last
saturday. the company hopes this single-stage rocket technology
demonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (ssto)
rocket ship.
the white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the white sands
missile range in new mexico this week. flight tests will start in
mid-june.
although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for
ssto research remains cloudy. the sdi organization -- which paid 60
million for the dc-x -- can't itself afford to fund full development of a
follow-on vehicle. to get the necessary hundreds of millions required for
a sub-orbital dc-xa, sdio is passing a tin cup among its sister government
agencies.
sdio originally funded ssto research as a way to cut the costs for
orbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns. however, recent
changes in sdi's political marching orders and budget cuts have made ssto
less of a priority. today, the agency is more interested in using dc-x as
a step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.
sdio has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,
said col. simon ""pete"" worden, sdio's deputy for technology. but worden
declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the
program. ""i didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money i
have available to spend,"" he quipped at a press conference at mcdonnell
douglas astronautics headquarters.
while sdio has lowered its sights on the program's orbital
objective, agency officials hail the dc-x as an example of the ""better,
faster, cheaper"" approach to hardware development. the agency believes
this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that ""leapfrog"" ahead of
evolutionary technology developments.
worden said the dc-x illustrates how a ""build a little, test a
little"" approach can produce results on time and within budget. he said
the program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --
showed how today's engineers could move beyond the ""miracles of our
parents' time.""
""the key is management,"" worden said. ""sdio had a very light hand
on this project. we had only one overworked major, jess sponable.""
although the next phase may involve more agencies, worden said
lean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be
crucial. ""it's essential we do not end up with a large management
structure where the price goes up exponentially.""
sdio's approach also won praise from two california members of the
house science, space and technology committee. ""this is the direction
we're going to have to go,"" said rep. george brown, the committee's
democratic chairman. ""programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren't
sustainable....nasa hasn't learned it yet. sdio has.""
rep. dana rohrbacher, brown's republican colleague, went further.
joking that ""a shrimp is a fish designed by a nasa design team,""
rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it
were left to the civil space agency.
rohrbacher, whose orange county district includes mcdonnell
douglas, also criticized nasa-air force work on conventional, multi-staged
rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. ""let's not
build fancy ammunition with capsules on top. let's build a spaceship!""
although rohrbacher praised sdio's sponsorship, he said the
private sector needs to take the lead in developing ssto technology.
mcdonnell douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its
c-17 transport and space station freedom programs, were more cautious
about a large private secotro commitment. ""on very large ventures,
companies put in seed money,"" said charles ordahl, mcdonnell douglas'
senior vice president for space systems. ""you need strong government
investments.""
while the government and industry continue to differ on funding
for the dc-xa, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to
development. citing corporate history, they liken the process to douglas
aircraft's dc aircraft. just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for
the dc-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could
eventually lead to an orbital delta clipper (dc-1).
flight tests this summer at white sands will ""expand the envelope""
of performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude. the
first tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle
take-off and landing. the second series will send the unmanned dc-x up to
5,000 feet. the third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000
feet.
maneuvers will become more complex on third phase. the final
tests will include a ""pitch-over"" manever that rotates the vehicle back
into a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.
the flight test series will be supervised by charles ""pete""
conrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the apollo 12 moon landing.
now a mcdonnell douglas vice president, conrad paised the vehicles
aircraft-like approach to operations. features include automated
check-out and access panels for easy maintainance.
if the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will
become a key consideration. this engine would have more thrust than the
pratt whitney rl10a-5 engines used on the dc-x. each motor uses liquid
hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of
thrust
based on the engine used in centaur upper stages, the a-5 model
has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on
throttling capability. it also is designed for repeat firings and rapid
turnaround.
worden said future single-stage rockets could employ
tri-propellant engine technology developed in the former soviet union.
the resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and
then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.
the mechanism for the teaming may already be in place. pratt has
a technology agreement with npo energomash, the design bureau responsible
for the tri-propellant and energia cryogenic engines."

date: tue, 06 apr 93 16:00:21 pdt
from: richard buenneke 4 06 93: gibbons outlines space station redesign guidance
nasa headquarters, washington, d.c.
april 6, 1993
release: 93-64
dr. john h. gibbons, director, office of science and technology
policy, outlined to the members-designate of the advisory committee on the
redesign of the space station on april 3, three budget options as guidance
to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space
station.
a low option of 5 billion, a mid-range option of 7 billion and a
high option of 9 billion will be considered by the committee. each
option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal
year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,
operations, utilization, shuttle integration, facilities, research
operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program
reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.
over the next 5 years, 4 billion is reserved within the nasa
budget for the president's new technology investment. as a result,
station options above 7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting
reductions in the rest of the nasa budget. for example, a space station
option of 9 billion would require 2 billion in offsets from the nasa
budget over the next 5 years.
gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of
the advisory committee. generally, the members-designate focused upon
administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted. they also
received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the
station redesign team is following to develop options for the advisory
committee to consider.
gibbons also announced that the united states and its
international partners -- the europeans, japanese and canadians -- have
decided, after consultation, to give ""full consideration"" to use of
russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.
to that end, the russians will be asked to participate in the
redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign
team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of mir
and the possible use of mir and other russian capabilities and systems.
the u.s. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of
the russian participants in assessing russian systems and technology. the
overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing
station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.
careful integration of russian assets could be a key factor in achieving
that goal.
gibbons reiterated that, ""president clinton is committed to the
redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the
science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program
represents. however, he also is committed to a space station that is well
managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should
be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.""
nasa administrator daniel s. goldin said the russian
participation will be accomplished through the east-west space science
center at the university of maryland under the leadership of roald
sagdeev."

to which you must subscribe...
fred, we're all supporting what each of us thinks should be done, to some
degree. if you have a problem with what nick thinks should be done,
address it, instead of just complaining about his doing so.
you really don't get what the 'complaints' are about, do you? not incredibly clear explanation of complaints...something between
feelings regarding nick's method, and judgments about his meaning t
f fred's issue 1; nick's alleged trashing of others i only got it when you stopped trashing, and made your point patently,
instead of 'allegorically'. that was my point all along, fred.
i see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of interpretations, not
least of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is
and is not debate. suffice to say that i disagree with you on that last
point. why don't you take a poll, fred, if you want some psuedo-objective
point-of-view?
and, as usual, you defend your insults with ""he started it."" ""yeah, i
took some of his research and called it my own, but he started it."" ""so
what if i stole his car, he stole my lawnmower first."" besides that, i
think it's still open to interpretation whether nick actually did start it.
so your defense, besides being lame, and contradicting the first part of
the sentence in which it occurs, may not even apply anyway.
your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool: ""i
never borrowed it, i already gave it back, and it was broken when you
gave it to me."" make up yer mind, fred!
first, i try to address what i think you meant, for which i am rewarded
with a denial of sorts, and a smart remark. then, i point out that i am
not clear what you did mean, rather than risking your childish ire, wrongly
interpreting you a second time, and i'm stupid for it. i just can't win,
can i, fred? you've got a great point here somewhere, it's just that
between stupid people that you must insult, and your jealous guarding of
your valuable opinions, you never actually get around to making it. fred issue 2; nick's alleged meaning too bad the plan only exists in your mind, instead of nick's, or you
would have a really good point. instead you have provided a good reason
to ignore your insults, since they are based on incorrect interpretations
that you have made about others. forgive me for giving your insults more
meaning than they ever should have had.
my reading of what nick actually said is that ""people aren't required in
all parts of all space processes"", so your taking issue with his opinions
regarding people in the space program, i read as ""people are required in
all parts of all space processes."" so, help me out, here, fred, since i'm
so patently stupid. did you read nick wrong? or are you going to eat
your terminal now? if the latter, i sure hope it's one of those cheeto and
string models that all the computer mags have been raving about :-)
the point is, i am not stupid because of your incorrect assumption. i'd
only be stupid if i insulted you for having made it. but, alas, that's your
job, fred.
and, finally, your style is confusing, since you tried to make two points,
simultaneously, with an allegory insult. sadly, one point addressed a 'plan'
that only existed in your mind, and the other took issue with behaviors that
you do as much as anyone.
no, no, i finally got it. you don't like the plan that nick's posts made
you imagine. and you don't like nick's obnoxious behavior, even though
it's no worse than your own. thanks for taking the time with someone as
dense as myself.
of course, socrates. how could it be otherwise?
who cares who came on the net first? if you do, consider that you saw
me come on after a brief haitus, before which i was on for about 2 years.
if you had seen me on the net first, you'd remember when nick and i went
down exactly the same road regarding rude, unneccesary behavior. it's
just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that's
no worse than your own.
let's see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical,
while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn't, and my
complaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-calling
isn't. yeah, right. maybe if you called me some more names, i might
see it better, fred.
""net.ghod wannabe""? naturally, fred, you've correctly interpreted my
motivations, when yours are impossible to judge from your actions (as
your insulting of people that try, proves). i didn't really care about
people that fill the net with personal garbage, what i really wanted was to
impress everyone. i only put my complaints with your behavior on private
mail, not because it belongs there, but because i thought you were such a
jerk that you'd bring it back to the net, playing right into my hands.
alas, i had no idea what an intellectual master you were, turning tables and
bringing the history of these posts to the net, for the noble and valuable
purpose of embarassing me. whether i should feel stupid because i tried
to make suggestions to such a superior intellect, or becuase i tried to
communicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass, still isn't clear.
well, fred, you exposed me. now i'll never be able to get a(nother) job
with nasa, since they all know that i'm stupider than fred mccall. well,
i just hope you're happy. please leave me alone, now. i just don't

post-launch
april 9 - 15, 1993
spacecraft
1. on april 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire
celestial reference after completion of the low gain antenna (lga-2)
swing dual drive actuator (dda) hammer activities.
2. on april 9, the ej-1 (earth-jupiter 1) sequence memory load was uplinked
to the spacecraft without incident. this sequence covers spacecraft activity
from april 12, 1993 to june 14, 1993 and includes a window for the radio relay
antenna (rra) slew test on april 28, 1993. the command loss timer was set to
11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.
3. on april 12 and 15, a no-op command was sent to reset the command loss
timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.
4. on april 12, cruise science memory readouts (mros) were performed for the
extreme ultraviolet spectrometer (euv), dust detector (dds), and magnetometer
(mag) instruments. preliminary analysis indicates the data was received
properly.
5. on april 12, an ultra-stable oscillator (uso) test was performed to verify
the health status of the uso and to collect gravitational red shift experiment
data; long term trend analysis is continuing.
6. on april 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the
optimal signal-to-noise ratio (snr) when transmitting at 40bps. preliminary
analysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation
index is near the optimal level.
7. on april 15, cruise science memory readouts (mros) were performed for the
extreme ultraviolet spectrometer (euv) and magnetometer (mag) instrument.
preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.
8. on april 15, a periodic rpm (retro-propulsion module) 10-newton thruster
flushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed
during the activity. thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.
9. the ac dc bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant
changes (greater than 25 dn) throughout this period. the ac measurement reads
19 dn (4.3 volts). the dc measurement reads 111 dn (12.9 volts). these
measurements are consistent with the model developed by the ac dc special
anomaly team.
10. the spacecraft status as of april 15, 1993, is as follows:
a) system power margin - 60 watts
b) spin configuration - dual-spin
c) spin rate sensor - 3.15rpm star scanner
d) spacecraft attitude is approximately 18 degrees
off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)
e) downlink telemetry rate antenna- 40bps(coded) lga-1
f) general thermal control - all temperatures within
acceptable range
g) rpm tank pressures - all within acceptable range
h) orbiter science- instruments powered on are the pws,
euv, uvs, epd, mag, hic, and dds
i) probe rrh - powered off, temperatures within
acceptable range
j) cmd loss timer setting - 264 hours

1. galileo participated in a second dsn (deep space network) acceptance test
for the dsn telemetry phase 3 upgrade on april 13, 1993, using cta-21
(compatibility test area 21). the purpose of this test was to verify
the flow of galileo telemetry data through the new telemetry group controller
(tgc) and the telemetry channel assembly (tca). the tgc tca is the replacement
for the current telemetry processing assembly (tpa). seven different telemetry
rates were run for this test; all ran well on both the mts (mccc telemetry
subsystem) and the ammos mgds v18.0 gif with the exception of 10bps. the
10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the tgc tca was
not metering the data correctly. further comparisons between the mgds and mts
data from this test are being conducted. mvt (mission verification test) of
the tgc tca system is expected to begin may 16, 1993.

for immediate release april 15, 1993 1506
scientists at nasa's jet propulsion laboratory report the
successful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to
measure and study chemicals in the earth's ozone layer.
the april 3 flight from california's barstow daggett airport
reached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took
measurements as part of a program established to correlate data
with the upper atmosphere research satellite (uars).
the data from the balloon flight will also be compared to
readings from the atmospheric trace molecular spectroscopy
(atmos) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle
discovery.
""we launch these balloons several times a year as part of an
ongoing ozone research program. in fact, jpl is actively
involved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three
important ways,"" said dr. jim margitan, principal investigator on
the balloon research campaign.
""there are two jpl instruments on the uars satellite,"" he
continued. ""the atmos experiment is conducted by jpl scientists,
and the jpl balloon research provides collaborative ground truth
for those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own
right.""
the measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more
pieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the
mid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring.
understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps
scientists construct more accurate computer models which are
instrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.
the scientific balloon payload consisted of three jpl
instruments: an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures
ozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;
a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave
radiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a fourier
transform infrared interferometer which monitors how the
atmosphere absorbs sunlight.
launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-
hour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130
kilometers per hour (70 knots). data was radioed to ground
stations and recorded onboard. the flight ended at 10 p.m.
pacific time in eastern new mexico when the payload was commanded
to separate from the balloon.
""we needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared
measurements,"" margitan explained, ""and we also needed to fly in
darkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.""
it will be several weeks before scientists will have the
completed results of their experiments. they will then forward
their data to the uars central data facility at the goddard space
flight center in greenbelt, maryland for use by the uars
scientists.
the balloon was launched by the national scientific balloon
facility, normally based in palestine, tex., operating under a
contract from nasa's wallops flight facility. the balloon was
launched in california because of the west-to-east wind direction
and the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.
the balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than
one-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic
meters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with
helium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter). the balloons weigh
between 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds). the
scientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds
and is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.
the jpl balloon research is sponsored by nasa's upper
atmosphere research program and the uars correlative measurements

local national space society chapters sponsor talk by l.a.
advocate of lunar power system as energy source for the world
on april 21, the oasis and ventura county chapters of the national

inventor and vice-president of the lps coalition, dr. robert d.
waldron. it will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the rockwell science
center in thousand oaks, ca.
dr. waldron is currently a technical specialist in space
materials processing with the space systems division of rockwell
international in downey, california. he is a recognized world
authority on lunar materials refinement. he has written or
coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial
materials processing or utilization. along with dr. david
criswell, waldron invented the lunar solar power system concept.
momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal
experts, and soviet and u.s. scientists and engineers to build
the lunar power system, a pollution-free, energy source with a
potential to power the globe.
for the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half
from california, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific
concept of a solar power system based on the moon.
the lps concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar
surface and beaming the power to earth as microwaves transmitted
through orbiting antennae. a mature lps offers an enormous
source of clean, sustainable power to meet the earth's ever
increasing demand using proven, basic technology.
oasis (organization for the advancement of space
industrialization) is the greater los angeles chapter of the
national space society, which is an international non-profit
organization that promotes development of the space frontier.

see the discussion of ""high-power rocketry"" in the rec.models.rockets

this is not hardware you can walk in off the street and buy; you need
proper certification. that can be had, mostly through tripoli (the high-
power analog of the nar), although the nar is cautiously moving to extend
the upper boundaries of what it considers proper too.
you need special faa authorization, but provided you aren't doing it under
one of the lax runway approaches or something stupid like that, it's not
especially hard to arrange.
as with model rocketry, this sort of hardware is reasonably safe if handled
properly. proper handling takes more care, and you need a lot more empty
air to fly in, but it's basically just model rocketry scaled up. as with
model rocketry, the high-power people use factory-built engines, which
eliminates the major safety hazard of do-it-yourself rocketry.

from the description of ad here, it sounds like they're talking about

has been flourishing from early 1980s and is becoming increasing popular.
technically this is not consider amateur rocketry.
any rocket with a liftoff weight greater than 3.3 pounds or using a

typically, a group of people get an faa waiver for specified period
of time (ie week, weekend, etc.) at a designated site and time, and
all of the launches are then covered under this ""blanket waiver"".
there is also a ""high power safety code"" which designates more

q. what kind of question is that? anyone who can read sees signs,
tracts, books, and bumper stickers that say, ""god loves you."" isn't
that true?
a. it is true that god offers his love to the whole world, as we read
in one of the most quoted verses in the bible:
for god so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten
son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but
have everlasting life. john 3:16
however, god's love is qualified. the bible says:
the way of the wicked is an abomination unto the lord: but he
loveth him that followeth after righteousness. proverbs 15:9
for the lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of
the ungodly shall perish. psalm 1:6
q. but i am not wicked. i am a decent, moral person. surely the good
i have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad i have done. how
can these verses apply to me?
a. by god's standard of righteousness even the most moral person is
looked upon by god as a desperate sinner on his way to hell. the
bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to heaven.
on the contrary, we are all sinners and we are all guilty before
god.
as it is written, there is none righteous, no, not one: there
is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after
god. romans 3:10-11
the heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately
wicked: who can know it? jeremiah 17:9
q. if i am such a wicked person in god's sight, what will god do to me?
a. the bible teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will
come under eternal punishment in a place called hell.
for a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the
lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase,
and set on fire the foundations of the mountains. i will heap
mischiefs upon them; i will spend mine arrows upon them. they
shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,
and with bitter destruction: i will also send the teeth of
beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.
deuteronomy 32:22-24
q. oh, come on now! hell is not real, is it? surely things are not
that bad.
a. indeed, hell is very real, and things are that bad for the individ-
ual who does not know the lord jesus christ as savior. the bible
makes many references to hell, indicating that it is both eternal
and consists of perpetual suffering.
and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was
cast into the lake of fire. revelation 20:15
so shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come
forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, and shall
cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and
gnashing of teeth. matthew 13:49-50
... when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with
his mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them
that know not god, and that obey not the gospel of our lord
jesus christ: who shall be punished with everlasting
destruction from the presence of the lord, and from the glory
of his power; 2 thessalonians 1:7-9
q. that is terrible! why would god create a hell?
a. hell is terrible, and it exists because god created man to be
accountable to god for his actions. god's perfect justice demands
payment for sin.
for the wages of sin is death; romans 6:23
for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ;
that every one may receive the things done in his body,
according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.
2 corinthians 5:10
but i say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak,
they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.
matthew 12:36
q. does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought
to life again to be judged and then to be sent to hell?
a. indeed it does; that is, unless we can find someone to be our
substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal damnation for our
sins. that someone is god himself, who came to earth as jesus
christ to bear the wrath of god for all who believe in him.
all we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one
to his own way; and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of
us all. isaiah 53:6
but he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for
our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him;
and with his stripes we are healed. isaiah 53:5
for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also
received, how that christ died for our sins according to the
scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the
third day according to the scriptures: 1 corinthians 15:3-4
for he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that
we might be made the righteousness of god in him.
2 corinthians 5:21
q. are you saying that if i trust in christ as my substitute, who was
already punished for my sins, then i will not have to worry about
hell anymore?
a. yes, this is so! if i have believed in christ as my savior, then it
is as if i have already stood before the judgment throne of god.
christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins.
he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life: and he
that believeth not the son shall not see life; but the wrath
of god abideth on him. john 3:36
q. but what does it mean to believe on him? if i agree with all that
the bible says about christ as savior, then am i saved from going to
hell?
a. believing on christ means a whole lot more than agreeing in our
minds with the truths of the bible. it means that we hang our whole
lives on him. it means that we entrust every part of our lives to
the truths of the bible. it means that we turn away from our sins
and serve christ as our lord.
no man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,
and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and
despise the other. ye cannot serve god and mammon.
matthew 6:24
repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be
blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the
presence of the lord; acts 3:19
q. are you saying that there is no other way to escape hell except
through jesus? what about all the other religions? will their
followers also go to hell?
a. yes, indeed. they cannot escape the fact that god holds us account-
able for our sins. god demands that we pay for our sins. other
religions cannot provide a substitute to bear the sins of their
followers. christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and
save us.
neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none
other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be
saved. acts 4:12
jesus said:
i am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the
father, but by me. john 14:6
if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us
our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
1 john 1:9
q. now i am desperate. i do not want to go to hell. what can i do?
a. you must remember that god is the only one who can help you. you
must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of god. as you see
your hopeless condition as a sinner, cry out to god to save you.
and the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much
as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,
god be merciful to me a sinner. luke 18:13
... sirs, what must i do to be saved? and they said, believe
on the lord jesus christ, and thou shalt be saved, ...
acts 16:30-31
q. but how can i believe on christ if i know so little about him?
a. wonderfully, god not only saves us through the lord jesus, but he
also gives us the faith to believe on him. you can pray to god that
he will give you faith in jesus christ as your savior.
for by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
yourselves: it is the gift of god: ephesians 2:8
god works particularly through the bible to give us that faith. so,
if you really mean business with god about your salvation, you
should use every opportunity to hear and study the bible, which is
the only word of god.
in this brochure, all verses from the bible are within indented
paragraphs. give heed to them with all your heart.
so then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of
god. romans 10:17
q. but does this mean that i have to surrender everything to god?
a. yes. god wants us to come to him in total humility, acknowledging
our sinfulness and our helplessness, trusting totally in him.
the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit: a broken and a
contrite heart, o god, thou wilt not despise. psalm 51:17
because we are sinners we love our sins. therefore, we must begin
to pray to god for an intense hatred of our sins. and if we
sincerely desire salvation, we will also begin to turn from our sins
as god strengthens us. we know that our sins are sending us to
hell.
unto you first god, having raised up his son jesus, sent him
to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his
iniquities. acts 3:26
q. doesn't the bible teach that i must attend church regularly and be
baptized? will these save me?
a. if possible, we should do these things, but they will not save us.
no work of any kind can secure our salvation. salvation is god's
sovereign gift of grace given according to his mercy and good pleas-
ure. salvation is
not of works, lest any man should boast. ephesians 2:9
q. what else will happen at the end of the world?
a. those who have trusted in jesus as their savior will be transformed
into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with christ forever-
more.
for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,
with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of god:
and the dead in christ shall rise first: then we which are
alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the
clouds, to meet the lord in the air: and so shall we ever be
with the lord. 1 thessalonians 4:16-17
q. what will happen to the earth at that time?
a. god will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens
and a new earth where christ will reign with his believers forever-
more.
but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night; in
the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and
the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and
the works that are therein shall be burned up. ...
nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new
heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
2 peter 3:10,13
q. does the bible give us any idea of when the end of the earth will
come?
a. yes! the end will come when christ has saved all whom he plans to
save.
and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end
come. matthew 24:14
q. can we know how close to the end of the world we might be?
a. yes! god gives much information in the bible concerning the timing
of the history of the world and tells us that while the day of the
lord will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved, it will not
come as a thief for the believers. there is much evidence in the
bible that the end of the world and the return of christ may be
very, very close. all the time clues in the bible point to this.
for when they shall say, peace and safety; then sudden
destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with
child; and they shall not escape. 1 thessalonians 5:3
surely the lord god will do nothing, but he revealeth his
secret unto his servants the prophets. amos 3:7
q. but that means judgment day is almost here.
a. yes, it does. god warned ancient nineveh that he was going to
destroy that great city and he gave them forty days warning.
and jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he
cried, and said, yet forty days, and nineveh shall be
overthrown. jonah 3:4
q. what did the people of nineveh do?
a. from the king on down they humbled themselves before god, repented
of their sins, and cried to god for mercy.
but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry
mightily unto god: yea, let them turn every one from his evil
way, and from the violence that is in their hands. who can
tell if god will turn and repent, and turn away from his
fierce anger, that we perish not? jonah 3:8-9
q. did god hear their prayers?
a. yes. god saved a great many people of nineveh.
q. can i still cry to god for mercy so that i will not come into judg-
ment?
a. yes. there is still time to become saved even though that time has
become very short.
how shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which
at the first began to be spoken by the lord, and was confirmed
unto us by them that heard him; hebrews 2:3
in god is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,
and my refuge, is in god. trust in him at all times; ye
people, pour out your heart before him: god is a refuge for
us. psalm 62:7-8

i have read mr. camping's book, compared it with what the bible actual-
ly says, find it to be the most credible research with respect to what
the future holds that i have ever come across, and agree with him that
there is just too much data to ignore. while none of us is guaranteed
one more second of life, and while we, therefore, should take these
matters very seriously regardless of when christ will actually return,
it would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our
eternal destiny until we feel that our death is imminent is even more
senseless now because, in all likelihood, the law of averages with
respect to life expectancy no longer applies. if you wish to obtain a

fitzmyer is one of the preeminent modern nt scholars. he was also one

pop quiz: what's wrong with the cover of this book? ;)"
20490.eml,soc.religion.christian,"lately, i think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportion
of sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do
(which is necessary because no one knows what's happening next) is growing.
example. last sunday (palm sunday) we went to the local church. usually
on palm sunday, the congregation participates in reading the passion, taking
the role of the mob. the theology behind this seems profound--when we say
""crucify him"" we mean it. we did it, and if he came back today we'd do it
again. it always gives me chills. but last week we were ""invited"" to sit
during the gospel ( passion) and listen . besides the orwellian ""invitation"",
i was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away. this seems
typical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward the
musicians, readers, and so on. new things are introduced in the course of the
liturgy and since no one knows what's happening, the new things have to be
explained, and pretty soon instead of doing a lot of the mass we're just
sitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the mass is about
to be done. in my mind, i lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay
""experts"", but that may not be just. i do think that a liturgy committee has a
bias toward doing something rather than nothing--that's just a fact of
bureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for
people to be aware of the lord's presence.
so we've been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the mass

from the discussions i have been in, and from how i have interpreted

before jesus, the people talked to god (no other way) and he talked
back. (audible and dreams, etc.) today we have the bible to know
gods will, and we have his son you died for us. he was given as our
savior, and while we still do things according to gods will, we pray
through his son. in the bible it says that if we are not known to
jesus, we are not known to god. (sorry i do not have the verses
with me) so, if we are to be granted eternal life, we must present
ourselves to jesus first, who will then present us to god.

20499.eml,soc.religion.christian,"there are a lot of people running around saying ""god told me this"" and
""god told me that"" these days. some people really have heard god, and others
heard their glands. mario murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once. he
said someone told him, ""the lord gave me a song."" he said that it was
the worst song he had ever heard.
""i know why he gave you that song,"" murillo said, ""he didn't want it anymore.""
but god does still speak to his people today, and the idea is contrary to the
idea of a closed cannon. ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the spirit
in the church of his day (2nd and 3rd century) and he was one of the first
to put forth a new testament cannon, which was almost identical to the one
we have today. he believed in a closed cannon.
many prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the scriptures.
for example, one prophet in kings, whose name starts with an ""m"" who
prophecied that the king would lose a battle. that is the only prophecy
he gave recorded in scripture, and we no that he had given other prophecies
because the king complained before he heard the prophecy, ""he never prophesies
anything good about me."" yet only one little paragraph of all of his
lifetime of prophecies are recorded in scripture. there are numerous examples.
barnabas was a prophet, acts says, before he was even sent out as an
apostle. yet his writings are not recorded in scripture. only two of
agabus prophecies are mentioned in scripture. he was already a prophet
before he gave them.
so prophecy may be genuine and from god, but that does not make it
scripture.
i don't know about translations of scripture, but i am familiar with
prophecies that give applications for scripture. there are also
similar examples in the bible. several times peter interprets prophecies
in a seemingly prophetic way, for example, ""and his bishoprick let another
take"" concerning judas office.
a clearer example can be found in matthew 24. jesus is prophesying about
what will happen before his return and he quotes a passage out of joel
about the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood. so scriptural
prophecy can be used in later prophecy.
sometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge,
but gifts of the spirit seem to overlap. words of knowledge and wisdom
can overlap. the word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap.
interpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy. healings are often
considered miracles. so sometimes the distinction between gifts is a
bit hazy. imho, it doesn't usually matter that much if we are able to
label a phenomenon, as long as we recognize them as the work of the
spirit, and use them according to his leading.

20500.eml,soc.religion.christian,"yes, it's important to realize that all actions have consequences,
and that ""rules"" were made for our own good. but to suggest that a disease is a punishment for certain types of sin i think is
taking things much too far. if we got some kind of mouth disease
for lying, would any of us have mouths left? what if we developed
blindness every time we lusted after someone or something? i dare
say all of us would be walking into walls.
yes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be real careful when saying that the consequences are a punishment for
sin. the jews of jesus's time believed that all sickness was the
result of a sin. then jesus healed a blind man and said that man was
blind to show the glory of god, not because of sin. if aids, or any
other std is a punishment"" for sexual sin, what do we do with
diseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as
debilitating and terrible as aids, yet are not usually linked to a
specific behavior or lifestyle?
atonement is extremely important, but i think you've missed the mark
about as far as you can by suggesting that aids is an atonement for sin.
the atonement for sin is jesus christ - period. this is the central
message of the gospel. a perfect sacrifice was required for our sins,
and was made in the lamb of god. his sacrifice atoned for all of
our sins, past present and future. god does not require pennance for
our sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement. he
has graciously already done that for us. to suggest that aids or
some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting
on the sacrifice that jesus made.
in case you couldn't tell, i get extremely angry and upset when
i see things like this. instead of rationalizing our own fears and
phobias, we need to be reaching out to people with aids and other
socially unacceptable diseases. whether they got the disease through
their own actions or not is irrelevant. they still need jesus christ,
no more and no less than we do. i've said this before, but i think
it's a good analogy. people with aids are modern-day lepers. jesus
healed many lepers. he can also heal people with aids, maybe not on
this earth, but in an ultimate sense. my next-door neighbor has aids.
she has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed
relationship with god. her theology isn't what i would want it to be,
but god's grace covers her. the amazing thing is that she is gaining
weight (she's had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is
excellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such. she attributes
her improvement in her health to god's intervention in her life. who
are we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment? it
seems to me that god is being glorified through her disease.

20502.eml,soc.religion.christian,"here's a topic to get things started. my daughter's christian school sends
home a weekly update on school related topics. this week they sent
something very interesting. it was an article written by the leader of a
national (us) christian school organization about a trip he recently made
to jerusalem. while there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is
working on a project to rebuild the temple at jerusalem. the article
included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in
preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the
specifications given in the bible.
what was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are
complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the israeli
government before beginning the building. the other startling fact is the
very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is
unoccupied and available for building. previously it has been thought that
the original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuilding
impossible without sparking a holy war.
now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming
sacrifices, as the scriptures indicate will happen in the last days.
although the israeli government will give the permission to start, i think
it is the hand of god holding the project until he is ready to let it
happen. brothers and sisters, the time is at hand. our redemption is

scourging. the whip that would be used would have broken pottery, metal,

this for a lie?' the second hit would drop you to your knees, you would
scream out in agony that your raw back was being torn at again. you would
say to yourself: all this for a lie?' and you had 37 more coming.
""at the third hit you would scream out that it was all a lie, beg for them
to stop, and tell them that you would swear on your life that it had all
been a lie, if they would only stop....""

20506.eml,soc.religion.christian,"-quinn eschatology is an area on which christians do not agree. i suspect
that's because our primary source of information is prophets and
visionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic. however
both jesus' teachings in the gospels and books such as the revelation
to john talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and
eternal death. on a number of occasions jesus does say things that
imply some sort of differentiation, e.g. lk 10:14 and a number of
similar passages where jesus says things like ""even xxx will be better
off than you in the judgement."" also, i cor 3 talks about someone who
gets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were. but these
passages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens,
so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or
hell (and not all christians would even go as far as that). the only
christian group i know of that believes in multiple heavens is the
mormons, and they are very far from mainstream christianity (far
enough that many of our readers would not call them christian). their
ideas in this area involve specific mormon revelations, in addition
to the bible and ""holy tradition"" of a more generic christian sort.
note that many christians will cringe at the very thought of
associating grading with god. the whole point of christ was to free
us from the results of a test that we couldn't possibly pass. if you
like test analogies, god grades on a very strict and unbending scale,
but he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that
was prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading.
because some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it's easy to
see why you'd be inclined to think of it as grading. while there are
differences among branches of christianity on details, i think we all
agree that in one way or another, god cheats.
i am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly
how far god's cheating extends. will he accept people who don't
explicitly acknowledge christ, but somehow still follow him in their
hearts? many christians believe that this is possible, at least in
principle, but certainly not all do. jesus provided us with a clear
description of how to be saved, but it's not clear to me that he
provided an exact description of how he's going to place the dividing
line. certainly he made it clear that we can't expect to know whether
other individuals are saved or not."
20507.eml,soc.religion.christian,"this is one of the differences between ot prophecy and nt prophecy. in the
nt, it is expected that when believers gather,
- people will prophesy
- the prophecy must be judged (1 cor 14:29)
there is nothing about killing someone who makes a mistake.
scripture is scripture; there is no ""gift of scripture"". and i don't know
about you, but i know that i have made mistakes while filled with the
spirit. if you don't give grace to allow people to make mistakes, they
will never grow in the use of the spiritual gifts!
when we minister in my small group, i encourage people to speak out any
impressions or images they think might be from the lord. only by trying
will they know whether they were right or wrong -- and in either case,
they'll have a better handle on it the next time.
didn't you fall when you were learning to ride a bicycle? but you kept on
trying, and you learned both from your failures and your successes.
spiritual gifts are no different -- you get better with experience.
the canon of scripture is complete. does this mean that god no longer
speaks? i have heard his voice -- not audibly (though some have), but
clearly nonetheless. is what i heard equivalent to scripture? no. i have
never heard contemporary prophets claim that what they receive from the
lord is on the same level as scripture; on the contrary, those who are
mature obey the scriptures by submitting their prophecies to fellow
believers for judgement. and the most reliable yardstick for judging
prophecies is, certainly, the scriptures themselves. the canon is closed
does it matter what it is called? the question is not how to label it, but
how to receive it. words of knowledge, incidentally, are similar to
prophecy (and sometimes the two overlap), but generally it is supernatural
knowledge of some fact that could not be known otherwise. jon reid he is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose. - jim elliot"
20508.eml,soc.religion.christian,"the standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents
is probably the writing of friedrich blass, ""hermeneutrik und
kritik,"" einleitende und hilfsdisziplinen , vol 1 of handbuch der klassischen altertums- wissenshaft (noerdlingen:
beck, 1886). portions of this are described in nibley, the
prophetic book op mormon , pp 219-242 (slc: deseret book, 1989).
(if you want to attempt reading this be forewarned. nibley
describes blass as a typical german scholar who claims little
knowledge of his subject, then proceeds to exhaust both the subject
and the reader.) nibley's extract from blass's work is in the form
of ""rules for forgers."" it makes interesting reading.
i confess that i have not read blass's work, only nibley's extract
thereof. my german falls far short of what would be required and
as far as i know there is no english translation available. however,
i believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that
any competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient
document and at least determine if it is consistent with what one
would expect of a genuine document of that time frame. we will not
be able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to
determine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and
culture or is a later forgery.
actually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents:
1. alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof. for example
the dead sea scrolls. these can be tested by various scientific
means to determine the age of the paper, inks, and objects found
with them. this can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual
physical objects.
2. documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the
copy itself may be much more recent. for example we might find a
document which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something
from centuries ago (perhaps even having been through several
generations of copists). this is more of a problem but can still
be tested (although the test is not likely to be simple). we cannot
expect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so
we must confine our testing to the text itself.
it is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if
the document is really what it claims to be. they can only date the
document and identify its culture of origin. for example i've heard
of a letter supposed to have been written by jesus himself to a king
in what is now iraq. if this document were to actually turn up
scholars could date the paper and ink (assuming they have the
holograph). they could check the language, content and writing
style to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a
palestinian jew of that time. however even if all test results were
positive there is no way to determine if jesus himself actually
wrote it. we would know what time and culture it came from but
(barring a known sample of jesus handwriting or other clues for
comparison) scholarship must stop there. there is seldom any way to
determine who the actual author was.
as i say, i'm no expert on blas's work. i do remember some of the
tests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works.
specifically we might ask:
1. is the document internally consistent? does it contradict
itself? if the work it is short it would be relatively easy to
maintain internal consistency, even if it is a forgery. the
longer the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency.
for this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents.
2. is it consistent with the history and geography of the time?
again a short, non-specific work might not be testable but if the
writing is of any significant length no latter-day forger would be
able to escape detection. here we look for the minor, inconspicuous
things which someone from that culture would get right without even
thinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous
and trivial to check. the devil is in the details.
3. what about the literary style of the work, figures of speech
etc. any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that
seem strange to us. are there any such odd phrases in this book?
if so do they fit in with the culture?
of course there are complications if the document has been
translated, or possibly even if somebody just updated language
when he copied it. a few cases of language not from the culture
claimed may be allowed in recent copies. they cause problems and
reduce certainty to be sure but don't necessarily prove forgery.
these tests can be quite effective (given enough material to work
with) but they are not easy. they require the skills of the
historian, the linguist, the anthropologist etc. the questions to
ask are, ""is every aspect of this document consistent with what we
know about the culture of claimed origin?"" if there are things
which don't fit how significant are they? are problem areas due to
our lack of knowledge, later changes by copists or are they really
significant? there will often be some ambiguity since we never
know everything about the culture.
the end result of any such testing is occasionally certain
(particularly in the case of holographs or other ancient copies).
however often it may just be a probability or an indication that
the document (or maybe parts of it) is probably authentic (or
sometimes maybe other parts are later additions). this is often
unsettling to a generation raised on tv where all problems are
solved in 30 to 60 minutes with time out for commercials. it is,
however, the real world and what scholarship has to offer."
20509.eml,soc.religion.christian,"a question for you - can you give me the name of an organization or a
philosophy or a political movement, etc., which has never had anything
evil done in its name? you're missing a central teaching of christianity -
man is inherently sinful. we are saved through faith by grace. knowing
that, believing that, does not make us without sin. furthermore, not all
who consider themselves ""christians"" are (even those who manage to head
their own ""churches""). ""not everyone who says to me, 'lord, lord,' will
enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my father who
is in heaven."" - matt. 7:21.
again, what historical documents do you trust? do you think hannibal
crossed the alps? how do you know? how do you know for sure? what
historical documents have stood the scrutiny and the attempts to dis-
credit it as well as the bible has?
well, it's really a shame you feel this way. no one can browbeat you
into believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving
you further away. you need to ask yourself some difficult questions:
1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain
it. if the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this
salvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain
modern offshoots like the ""new age movement"" teach or does he require god's
help? 3) if the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such
help come? needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for
some people it did comprise their life's writings, so i am hardly in a
position to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask. few,
of us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives (certainly not me).
the spritual life is a difficult journey (if you've never read ""a pilgrim's
progress,"" i highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language).
now i see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be a
conflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing. you
wrote that ""i (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most
of the teachings of christ"". well, christ referred to god as ""my father"",
not ""my mother"", and while the ""maleness"" of god is not the same as the
maleness of those of us humans who possess a y chromosome, it does not
honor god to refer to him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory,
or politically correct. this in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent
to do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women -
english just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns). after all, god
chose a woman as his only human partner in bringing christ into the human
population.

20512.eml,soc.religion.christian,"no, imo, mr. stowell missed the point.
mr. stowell seems to have jumped rather strangely from truth to absolutes.
i don't see how that necessarily follows.
are all truths also absolutes?
is all of scripture truths (and therefore absolutes)?
if the answer to either of these questions is no, then perhaps you can
explain to me how you determine which parts of scripture are truths, and
which truths are absolutes. and, who is qualified to make these
determinations? there is hardly consensus, even in evangelical
christianity (not to mention the rest of christianity) regarding
biblical interpretation.

the catholic traditon has a list of behaviours called the spiritual
works of mercy:
admonish the sinner
instruct the ignorant
counsel the doubtful
comfort the sorrowful
bear wrongs patiently
forgive all injury
pray for the living and the dead (yes, i know there is some controversy
on this and i don't want to argue about it.)
these are all things that have a direct application to usenet. people
ask questions and express doubts. some are in need of comfort or
prayers. imagine what would happen to flame wars if we bore wrongs
patiently and forgave injuries. i would add that it is probably more
appropriate to do any admonishing by private email than publicly.

20516.eml,soc.religion.christian,"while i agree with most of jon says (i deleted those parts, of course), i
have serious reservations about this advice. maintaining a just
friends' level of relationship is much easier said than done. people
usually end up getting hurt. this is especially likely to happen when
they start off with feelings of attraction.
when people feel attracted those feelings can cloud their judgement.
i've had the experience of going quickly from believing that i shouldn't
date non-christians to believing that dating this man would be okay to
believing that premarital sex is fine when people really love each
other. when the relationship ended my beliefs immediately returned to
their original state.
this is an especially extreme case because i was young and away from home

feelings of attraction.

20517.eml,soc.religion.christian,"deleted i can't speak for mr. cavano, but i understood his comment to refer to
the idea that unrecognized pantheism is dangerous to christians. if we
unthinkingly adopt pantheistic ideas that are opposed to christianity,
we can pervert our faith. when we clearly recognize pantheism when we
encounter it we have the opportunity to embrace what is consistent with
christianity and reject what isn't.
we need to be alert, always thinking and questioning. we must examine
the underlying assumptions of every book we read, tv program we watch
and socio-political movement we participate in. ideas are important.
philosophies and doctrines are what give form to the events of our
lives. they are the basis from which we live our lives of love and
service. the command to love god with all one's mind means no fuzzy-
headed drifting from idea to idea.
one christian who acknowledges this is the pope. it is a frequent theme
in his writings. indeed, thoughtful christians from most traditions
recognize that consumerism has no place in the lives of christians. it
too is a perversion and dangerous to our faith. thank you, jack, for

20520.eml,soc.religion.christian,"this is an exaggeration of the protestant view. many protestants
have a strong appreciation for the role of the church. ""the soul
alone with god"" is certainly important for protestants, but it's by no
means the whole story.
i have read the sort of history you talk about. as you point out,
protestants don't have quite the same problem you do, because we
believe that the church had a fall at some point. however protestant
mythology typically places the fall around the time of constantine (or
more likely, regard it as happening in a sort of cumulative fashion,
starting from constantine but getting worse as the pope accumulated
power during the medieval period.) the consequences of having it
earlier are somewhat worrisome even to us. most protestants accept
the theological results of the early ecumenical councils, including
such items as the trinity and incarnation. indeed in the works of
reformers such as luther and calvin, you'll find church fathers such
as augustine quoted all the time. i think you'll find many
protestants resistant to the idea that the early church as a whole was
""wierd"". (there is an additional problem for protestants that i don't
much want to talk about in this context, since it's been looked at
recently -- that's the question of whether one can really think of
augustine and other fathers as being proto-protestants. their views
on mary, the authority of the pope, etc, are not entirely congenial to
protestant thought.)
one thing that somewhat worries me is a question of methodology.
there are certainly plenty of wierd people in the early church. what
concerns me is that they may be overrepresented in what we see. we
see every christian who courted martyrdom. but i think there's good
reason to believe that most ordinary christians were more prudent than
that. we see the heroic virgins. but i think there's good reason to
think that many christians were happily married. i can't help
suspecting that the early church had the same range of wierdos and
sane people that we do now. i think there's also a certain level of
""revisionism"" active in history at the moment. i don't mean that
they're manufacturing things out of whole cloth. but don't you think
there might be a tendency to emphasize the novel?"

of man is to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will

later."" mark 10:34 ""and they will mock him and spit upon him, and scourge him,

1 now i make known to you, brethren, the gospel which i preached to
you, which also you received, in which also you stand,
2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast the word which i
preached to you, unless you believed in vain.
3 for i delivered to you as of first importance what i also received,
that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures,
4 and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day
according to the scriptures, 5 and that he appeared to cephas, then to the twelve.
6 after that he appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one
time, most of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep;
7 then he appeared to james, then to all the apostles;
8 and last of all, as it were to one untimely born, he appeared to me
also.
9 for i am the least of the apostles, who am not fit to be called an
apostle, because i persecuted the church of god.
10 but by the grace of god i am what i am, and his grace toward me did
not prove vain; but i labored even more than all of them, yet not i,
but the grace of god with me.
11 whether then it was i or they, so we preach and so you believed.
12 now if christ is preached, that he has been raised from the dead,
how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
13 but if there is no resurrection of the dead, not even christ has
been raised;
14 and if christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain, your
faith also is vain.
15 moreover we are even found to be false witnesses of god, because we
witnessed against god that he raised christ, whom he did not raise,
if in fact the dead are not raised.
16 for if the dead are not raised, not even christ has been raised;
17 and if christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are
still in your sins.
18 then those also who have fallen asleep in christ have perished.
19 if we have hoped in christ in this life only, we are of all men most
to be pitied.
20 but now christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of
those who are asleep.
21 for since by a man came death, by a man also came the resurrection
of the dead.
22 for as in adam all die, so also in christ all shall be made alive.
23 but each in his own order: christ the first fruits, after that those
who are christ's at his coming,
24 then comes the end, when he delivers up the kingdom to the god and
father, when he has abolished all rule and all authority and power.
25 for he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.
26 the last enemy that will be abolished is death.
logical proofs of jesus christ's resurrection
1. jesus's enemies would not have stolen his
body because that would have perpetrated the
resurrection--the very opposite of what they
desired.
2. jesus' disciples could not have stolen his
body because pontius pilate established guards
to stand watch over the tomb lest his body be
stolen.
3. sadly (and ironically), many of jesus' disciples
did not believe in the resurrection until jesus
had risen from the dead.
4. in nearly 20 centuries, no body has ever been
produced to refute jesus' assertion that he would indeed rise from the dead.
5. the probability of being able to perpetrate such
a hoax successfully upon the entire world for
nearly 20 centuries is astronomically negative!"
20526.eml,soc.religion.christian,". . . having lived through the kicking and screaming in the 60s and 70s as the
catholics were invited to participate in the liturgy instead of counting
their rosary beads during mass, i find this comment interesting. there
is a massively longer tradition for proclaiming the passion accounts
without active participation. if you know the latin, one really
beautiful way to hear the passion is it's being chanted by three
deacons: the narrator chants in the middle baritone range, jesus chants
in the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor.
this is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the passion
that john would prefer.
but there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations.
each pastor makes his own decisions (it isn't a church-wide conspiracy
against participation). the palm sunday liturgy, with its initial
blessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is already
getting long before you get to the passion; some pastors feel that they
should not make the people stand through that long narrative. also, the
orchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation
in the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation
necessary to go with the briefer options just to ""get 'em in and get 'em
out"".
each parish is different. catholics are no longer canonically tied to
their geographic parishes. it is possible that another catholic parish
in the columbus area (based on the ohio state address) has a liturgy
closer to your preferences. or talk to some of your fellow
parishioners and see how common your preferences are --- pastors
generally are willing to listen to non-confrontational requests. though
you probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly
to the shock of people asked for a longer sunday mass.
perhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn't follow
the continuous evolution model (the accumulation of small changes, no
single one of which is too hard to take) but rather the punctuated
equilibrium model (things stay the same and we get accustomed to them,
then the marked mutation hits). my apologies if i am mis-remembering
the names of the evolutionary theories."
20527.eml,soc.religion.christian,"so what's your point? mark's comment still is valid. to suggest that
aids is ""deserved"" is ludicrous. i sin. i can resolve to abstain from
sin, and do weekly (more often, actually). yet i routinely fail.
i surely do deserve what i get, yet god compassionately provided
the incarnate logos, jesus, as a rememdy and a way out of our situation.
if aids is deserved, i surely deserve instant death just as much, as do
we all, as st. paul so cogently remids us.
to willingly judge ""others"" as deserving punishment seems to me
to be the height of arrogance and lack of humility.
so what's the point here? i can get aids and never engage in
""deviant"" sexual behavior. in fact, i could engage in lots
of deviant sexual behavior with hiv people and never be
infected. aids is a consequence of particular behaviors,
many of which are not sexual. and not all sexual behaviors
carry the risk of transmission.
the end of all things is to know, love and serve god, growing
daily closer through prayer, meditation and discipline. even so
i could get aids. anyone could, unless they remain forever celibate,
iv-drug-free, and transfusion free.

20528.eml,soc.religion.christian,"i wish that you had followed this thread before jumping to conclusions.
i haven't seen anybody write that aids was a punishment for certain
types of sin (this includes mark ashley who you were responding to
here). i myself wrote that when you don't do things god's way that
curses will come on you and others. although one definition of 'curse'
is 'retribution', i only meant 'harm or misfortune' when i used the
word. because god loves us he has told us the best way to live in his
bible. god doesn't cause curses, he warns us of them.
kevin davis wrote (a while ago):
the bible makes it clear that we all equally deserve death (which is
much worse than aids) -- we have all hurt god with our sin.
paul conditt reveals his feelings:
the first issue you bring up is your anger. it is ""obvious""ly wrong to
be angry (gal 5:19-20) for any reason, especially extremely angry
which is on par with hatred. jesus has every reason to be angry at us
for putting him on the cross with our sin, yet his prayer was ""forgive
them father, they know not what they do."" knowing how forgiving jesus
has been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out of
love for him. please don't give in to anger, it will only cause
foolish quarrels and more bad feelings.
it's okay if you read something that bothers you, but you need to
address it in a loving way. if right now, i felt like someone out
there was saying that god punishes gay or sexually immoral people with
aids because they deserve punishment that others don't then i would
frame a response something like this:
""it makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that aids, which is
simply a harmful disease not so unlike any other, is god's punishment
for people who have committed certain sins. god loves all of his
children equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him. we
will all be judged after we die, but until then we all have the
opportunity to accept god's grace by earnestly seeking after him with
all of our hearts, believing the gospel's testimony, repenting of our
sin, confessing that jesus is lord at baptism, and living a new life
for him.
let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned. god's arm is not
to short to save. he will do anything he can to move a hardened heart
or a misled person. he works for the good of all men. even through
the worst of situations, he has set the times and places for all men
that they may perhaps reach out and find him.""
the second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fears
of people with aids. fortunately, what you describe as seeing is
actually misperceiving. you have been missing the points made in the
earlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven't been
expressed. i know that its sometimes hard to discount your
perceptions, but please try to be open-minded.
you are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all people
because they all need jesus. this is what my brothers and sisters and
i do on a daily basis. if you would like to send me the name of the
city and state you live in, i will find and get you in touch with some
brothers who have aids or know people with aids and live nearby you so
that you can see the loving attitudes for yourself.
the third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individual
contracted aids. how someone gets aids is only relevant to their
salvation in that there may be repetence involved.
the important point to be made, however, is that not listening to god's
commands (or advice or warnings), i.e. sinning, causes harm or
misfortune to yourself and others. for this reason, a good way to
prevent the misfortune of aids, which can be transmitted in sinful ways,
is to listen to god's advice and have sex only with your wife or
husband.
i hope that you are feeling better now, paul.

dead."" rom. 6:4-therefore we are buried with him in baptism into death:
that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the
father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.""
those really want to celebrate the resurrection should by faith walk in
newness of life after baptism. it is not necessary to celebrate a pagan
goddess in the process.
paul answered your question in romans 9. in v. 4 he stated that the
adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of
god, and the promises were given to the israelites. it is a package deal.
he goes on to identify those who are true israelites. vs 6-8 makes it
plain that the true israelites are not those who are born that way but
those who accept the promise of god. paul continued to emphasize that he
was an israelite in 2 cor. 11:22, then in gal 3:29 he says that all those
who belong to christ are abraham's seed, and heirs to all the promises
given to the israelites. the promises come with the law. it is all or
nothing. why is it that you only want to discard one part of the law?
certainly you would want your husband to be faithful to you. or do you
believe that adultery is no longer forbidden? same law.

""and is came about that as saul journeyed, he was approaching
damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him; and
he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, ""saul, saul,
why are you persecuting me?"" and he said, ""who art thou, lord?"" and
he said, ""i am jesus whom you are persecuting, . . .""
(acts 9:3-5, nas)
paul received revelation directly from the risen jesus! (pretty cool, eh?) he
became closely involved with the early church, the leaders of which were
followers of jesus throughout his ministry on earth.
i agree. i don't believe anyone but the spirit would be able to convince you
the spirit exists. please don't complain about this being circular. i know
it is, but really, can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural?
(this is why revelation is necessary to the authors of the bible.)
the spirit is part of god. how much closer to the source can you get?
the greek in 2 timothy which is sometimes translated as ""inspired by god"",
literally means ""god-breathed"". in other words, god spoke the actual words
into the scriptures. many theologians and bible scholars (dr. james boice is

incompleteness of ""inspired by god"".
that's what the verse taken from 2 timothy was all about. the continuity of a
book written over a span of 1500 years by more than 40 authors from all walks
of life is a testimony to the single authorship of god.
what source to you claim to have discovered which has information of superior
historicity to the bible? certainly not josephus' writings, or the writings
of the gnostics which were third century, at the earliest.
jesus was fully god as well. that's why i'd assert that he is wise.
please rethink this last paragraph. if there is no god, which seems to be your
current belief, then jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because not
only did he assert that god exists, but he claimed to be god himself! (regards
to c.s. lewis) how then could you have the least bit of respect for jesus?
in conclusion, be careful about logically unfounded hypotheses based
on gut feelings about the text and other scholars' unsubstantiated claims.
the bible pleads that we take it in its entirety or throw the whole book out.
about your reading of the bible, not only does the spirit inspire the
writers, but he guides the reader as well. we cannot understand it in the
least without the spirit's guidance:

searches all things, even the depths of god."" (1 cor 2:10, nas)

conscience can be hardened by sin's deceitfulness (hebrews 3:12:13) so
that the person has no idea (or doesn't care about it) that they are
sinning. of course, there are those sins which we do when we don't know
that they're sinful to begin with. those take searching and examining
of scripture to find out that they are sinful and then repent and
change. the best question to ask in every circumstance to judge sinful

better?
according to the scriptures, splits and differences of opinion are going
to be there. as per a previous note, i mentioned that there are those
who teach falsely by many means. there are also differences of opinion
and belief. however, scripture states:
in the following directives i have no praise for you, for your
meetings do more harm than good. in the first place, i hear that when
you come together as a church, there re divisions among you, and to some
extent i believe it. no doubt there have to be differences among you to
show which of you have god's approval (1 corinthians 11:17-19).
how will god show his approval? by fruitfulness (see acts 2:47), but
before that, there are these qualities:
devotion to the apostles teaching
fellowship
communion
filling with awe for god
all having everything in common.
glad and sincere hearts
praising god
enjoying the favor of the people
all these are mentioned in acts 2:42-47. god also shows that those who
have these qualities are persecuted. look at stephen, ""a man full of
faith and of the holy spirit"" (acts 6:5) who was later stoned (acts
7:54-60).
one can say that a church is the true church only if that church is
perfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement. i
have yet to find that, but the closest one i've found is the boston
church of christ movement, which constantly strives to have errors
pointed out and corrected. it is also the only one i've seen which is
totally sold out to god.
as for cooperation, that can always occur. unity, on the other hand may
never occur. as for those who think about only one church being the
""true one"", i remind them that mark 9:38-41 states that there are
disciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with, but they
will not lose their reward. as with the boston movement, i've heard
numerous times this exact same thing, that there are disciples out there
that are not a part of the boston movement but that does not make them
any less disciples. of course, few people admit that they've ever run
into someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement.
i know i haven't.
i must warn that this sounds cliquey to me. a clique is a group which
runs around together to some extent exclusively. this causes problems
in fellowship and causes divisions. i would not say at all that this is
something ""correct"" for a church group to do for any reason. in one of
the churches i attended, for example, there was an internal clique of
people who were on the 14 different groups committees organizational
heads of the congregation. they rarely talked to anyone else outside of
the committees and seldom were voted out of office without another
office being ""opened up"" so that they would have to step right back in.
their degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came, he
nearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch (i wish he
would've since they still have no clue about what it means to be a
disciple). anyway, this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be
broken down, but is still there. so, i must warn against such division
within. there's enough division without.

simplistic propaganda model about catholicism not being faddish.
sure, it's so large that global fads take longer cycles than they
do in smaller denominations (and local ones are not usually visible
unless you do a lot of traveling to exotic lands :-)). may i recom-
mend, as a salutary antidote to this nonsense philippe aries' book the hour of our death , a longitudinal study of death customs in
western specifically catholic christendom?
and it won't help to escape into the obscurity of the first christian
century. paul was pretty weird, too; as were peter and the others in
the (apparently quite weird) circle around jesus.
what i think you might find helpful is a bit more charity -- try to
understand these weirdos and nutcases with the same respect and love
you would expect others to show your notions. we are commanded to
love one another, after all. and brown's book is, in fact, a heroic
attempt to see the groupings he talks about as motivated in love and
the gospel and their social contexts. (if anything, brown is too heroic here -- he manages to overstrain himself at times :-))
i don't suggest that we follow any of these old cult paths -- and
it raises hard questions from the skeptic inside me that so much of
early christianity was like the weird (christian and non-christian)
cults we see today. to that extent, i think you raise a serious
problem (and perhaps your phrasing is implicitly self-deprecatory
and ironic.)
but the first principle for answering these questions is respect and
love for those we do not understand. and it helps to work at under-
standing (as long as we do not get overwhelmed by revulsion and begin
to withdraw our respect for them as people.) i would advise, in other
words, more historical reading (brown's other books are also good, most
especially his bio. of augustine; also try robin lane fox's christians
and pagans , maybe the paul veyne ed. history of private life , some
of foucault's books on sexuality in the ancient world ...)

shk paganism, among other things, includes a reverence for the planet and
shk all life on the planet -- stemming from the belief that all life is
shk interconnected. so, rather than be something secular, it is something
shk very sacred.
i would go further, and say that much of the damage to the environment
has been caused by the secular worldview, or by the humanist
worldview, and especially by the secular humanist worldview.
this is not to say that all secular humanists are necessarily avid
destroyers of the environment, and i am sure that there are many who
are concerned about the environment. but at the time of the
renaissance and ref ormation in western europe man became the centre,
or the focus of culture (hence ""humanism""). this consciousness was
also secular, in the sense that it was concerned primarily with the
present age, r ather than the age to come. capitalism arose at the
same time, and the power of economics became central in philosophy.
this doesn't mean that economics did not exist before, simply that it
began to dominate the conscious cultural values of western european
society and its offshoots. this cultural shift was, in its later
stages, accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that
justified
them.
there was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of ""economics"" -
from the christian view of man as the economos, the steward, of
creation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces
and powers. there were denominational differences among the new
worshippers of mammon. for some the name of the deity was ""the free
rein of the market mechanism"", while for others it was ""the
dialectical forces of history"". but in both the capitalist west and
the socialist east the environment was sacrificed on the altar of
mammon. the situation was mitigated in the west because thos e who
were concerned about the damage to the environment had more freedom to
oppose what was happening and state their case.

mediator between god and men, the man christ jesus, who gave himself as
a ransom for all men--the testimony given in its proper time."" (1
timothy 2:5-6. also, ""there have been many of those priests talking

that they were saved by his death. god is not bound by our

20548.eml,soc.religion.christian,"the empty tomb: can we trust it?
by the late wilbur m. smith, d.d.
(1894-1977)
when jesus was on earth, he made an amazing prediction about
himself, and frequently repeated it. let me quote it for you:
behold, we go up to jerusalem; and the son
of man shall be betrayed unto the chief
priests and unto the scribes, and they shall
condemn him to death, and shall deliver him
to the gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and
to crucify him; and the third day he shall
rise again"" (matthew 20:18-19).
wholly different from the normal experience of men, jesus,
who had never done anything worthy of death, even deserving
reproval, knew he would die before he was 40 years of age. he
knew the very city where he would die. he knew that the religious
leaders of his own race would condemn him to death. he knew that
one of his own would betray him. he knew that before his actual
death took place he would be mocked and scourged. he knew exactly
how he would die-- by crucifixion. all this is in itself remarkable. but more amazing than the
minute particulars of his foreknowledge was what he predicted
would follow shortly after he was buried-- that he would rise
again. he even designated the time--on the third day.
but since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec-
tion of jesus christ--that the whole truth or untruth of chris-
tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.
the body of jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth
between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and
ointments was distributed. the body was placed in a tomb which
had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against
the entrance. the jewish authorities, fully aware that jesus had
predicted he would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and
on saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the
disciples from carrying away the body. early sunday morning some
of the women who were faithful followers of christ went out to the
tomb to further anoint the body. to their utter astonishment,
they found the stone rolled away, the body gone. they rushed back
to tell the disciples. shortly two of jesus' friends, peter and
john, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the
tomb empty, just as the women had said. even the guards came
hurrying into the city to tell the sanhedrin that had hired them
to guard the tomb that the body was gone (matthew 28:11).
how did this tomb become empty?
one of the most famous new testament scholars in america--
professor of new testament literature in a large theological
seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of how the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter not marked by
bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb
became empty than he could explain how santa claus comes down the
chimney at christmas time.
but he didn't realize that santa clause never did come down
any chimney at christmas time, because there never was a santa
claus! ...and there is a jesus. he died; he was buried in the
tomb of joseph of arimathea, and on sunday the body was gone.
those are facts of history. no one can escape the responsi-
bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by
mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.
another professor, dr. kirsopp lake of harvard university,
tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar
in the field of new testament criticism has ventured to adopt)
that the women went to the wrong tomb.
the facts are these:
first, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to
which by mistake they could have gone.
second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or
more people to forget the place where they have buried their
dearest loved one within less than three days. even if the women
did miss the tomb, when peter and john came, did they too go to
the wrong tomb?
third, were the soldiers guarding the wrong tomb?
there is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the
evidence of the empty tomb in the new testament itself.
now when they were going, behold, some
of the watch came into the city and showed
unto the chief priests all the things that
were done. and when they were assembled
with the leaders and had taken counsel, they
gave large money unto the soldiers, saying,
say ye, his disciples came by night, and stole
him away while we slept. and if this come to
the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and
secure you. so they took the money, and did
as they were taught: and this saying is com-
monly reported among the jews until this day
(matthew 28:11-15).
this is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the
fact that the tomb was empty.
you will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never
questioned but that the tomb was empty. they never even went out to
see if what the guards had reported was true--they knew it was true.
another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that
the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that jesus' disciples
came and stole the body away while they (the soldiers) were asleep! how could they know what was going on while they were asleep?
obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.
even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject
the explanation, the very character and the later history of the
disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away
the body of jesus.
first, as professor heffern points out, the leaders of judaism in
jerusalem, who had put the lord jesus to death, had nothing to offer to
contradict these disciples as they continued to preach jesus and his
resurrection--because all jerusalem knew the tomb was empty. if there
had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected,
then proved.
second, surely one of the disciples, even most of them, would
have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent.
it may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most
of these men did.
the result ultimately would have been that the message that christ
had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it
would have lost it power. instead, this truth swept the world, closed
pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing
humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today
as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.
but not only did jesus come alive again, he did not disappear to
leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to
what had happened to him.
instead, he appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.
he appeared to the women at the tomb on resurrection morning
(matthew 28:1-10); later that day to mary magdalene alone (john 20:11-
18); and to simon peter, also alone (luke 24:34). in the afternoon he
walked with two of his followers toward emmaus (luke 24:13-35); and that
night he appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper
room at jerusalem (mark 16:14-16; luke 24:36-40; etc.).
a week later he appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at
the same place (john 20:26-28). once he was seen by above 500 brethren
on a mountain in galilee (i corinthians 15:6); and finally to the
apostles just before his ascension (mark 16:19; luke 24:50-52; acts 1:3-
8).
as with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor-
ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed
attempting to deny their literalness. but these theories are
unreasonable, without supporting evidence. none has ever won the
unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the
appearances.
moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our
leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are
antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest
thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle.
increase mather, president of harvard; timothy dwight, president of yale;
nathan lord, president of dartmouth; edward hitchcock, president of
amherst; mark hopkins, president of williams; john witherspoon, president
of princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.
but suppose christ did rise from the dead, what of it? what has
it to do with my life? what has it to do with your life? just this:
it seals with certitude the teachings of christ.
jesus taught many great truths--especially many about himself. he
claimed to have come down from god.
he said he was the way to god.
he said he was the son of god, who alone knew god perfectly.
he said that whoever believed on him had eternal life, and no one
else had it.
he said that whatever we ask god in his name, he would grant it to
us.
thus when he did rise from the grave on the third day, he revealed
that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, he spoke the truth! do you know any reason, any good reason, why we should not believe
that his words are all true?
the point is, does not the truth of the resurrection convince us
that he is none other than the one he claimed to be--the son of god?
and then, of course, the fact that christ rose from the dead
testifies that he has broken the power of death, and that he will some
day raise us also up from the grave, as he promised.
in other words, if this person, jesus christ, the son of god, in all
this, he should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life. for
he said a life built on him would know forgiveness of sins, his compan-
ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a
hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day.
those who have tried it down through the ages-- and there have been
many --have given their testimony. and we today who believe also know."
20549.eml,soc.religion.christian,"my, this distinction seems quite arbitrary.
blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sin is covered.
(ps. 32:1).
and quoted by the apostle paul:
even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom god
imputeth righteousness without works,
saying, blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins
are covered.
blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin. (rom. 4:6-8)
the biblical perspective seems to be that foregiveness and covering are
parallel equivalent concepts in both testaments. the dispensational
distinction is unwarranted.
i'm sure rex has scripture to back this up. you're suggesting jesus is
going to travel around dealing with individual violations of his law -- for
millions perhaps billions of people. such activity for moses the lawgiver
was considered unwise (cf. ex. 18:13ff). it makes for interesting
speculation, though.
i'll leave comments on the so-called ""bema seat"" vs. ""throne"" judgments to
someone else. this also seems like more unnecessary divisions ala

20552.eml,soc.religion.christian,"many pagans are involved in environmentalism--this is only natural, since
respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations. this
doesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in
the middle east is wrong because jews and muslims also work for it.
nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as christians should
address this and look at what draws people from paganism to christianity. like
it or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that christianity should be,
and isn't.
i believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that christianity has
forgotten. this doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we
have something to learn from the pagan movement.
first, paganism respects the feminine. christianity has a long history of
oppressing women, and many (if not most) male christians are still unable to
live in a non-sexist manner. the idea that god is sexless, or that christ
could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great
deal of resistance. this insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the
male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have
had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.
second, paganism respects the physical world. this is an idea with great
ramifications. one of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings
and our world. another is integration of sexuality. christianity has a long
tradition of calling all sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress
and deny their sexuality. this is too much--sex is clearly a part of human
experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.
christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism
is an attractive option.
i'm not advocating that christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.)
should be changed--just that christians work toward a more moderate ethic of
sexuality. denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated
sexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to god.

discussions when i was in grade school:
a kid would say, ""all policemen are jerks!"" i'd ask, ""how do
you know?"" ""because my daddy told me so!"" ""how do you know
you're daddy is right?"" ""he says he's always right!""
well the argument usually stops right there. in the end,
aren't we all just kids, groping for the truth? if so, do we have
the authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as
false?
this is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup. i
apologize if i'm covering tired old ground. some of the
discussions on this topic have piqued my interest and i welcome
any comments. i'm sort of mystified about how a christian might respond to this. i
can understand criticisms of christianity that say there's not enough
evidence to believe it, or that there's just as good evidence for
other religions. i don't agree, but clearly there are plenty of
intelligent people who don't find the evidence convincing. but that
doesn't seem to be your point. rather, you seem upset that people who
believe christianity is true also believe that things which contradict
it are false.
this suggests a model of spiritual things that's rather different than
the christian one. it sounds more like an existentialist view, where
people choose what value to follow, but there's no actual independent
spiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in
some unique sense right. this sort of model -- with modifications of
one sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions. but
christianity is in its essense a ""historical"" religion. that is, it's
based on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out
there, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways,
and that we see evidence of that in history. in the ""mundane"" world,
we are not free to choose how things work. when we drop something, it
falls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn't). the
christian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual
external reality. i hope we're all honest enough not to claim that we
have perfect understanding. but while we may not think we know
everything, we are confident that we know some things. and that
implies that we think things that contradict them are false. i don't
see how else we could proceed.
this needn't result in arrogance. i'm certainly interested in talking
with people of other religions. they may have things to teach me, and
even if they don't, i respect them as fellow human beings. but it's
got to be possible to respect people and also think that on some
matters they are wrong. maybe even disasterously wrong."
20555.eml,soc.religion.christian,"sorry, but i think this interpretation of the matthew 13 parables is
nonsense. i.e.,
matthew 16:12 explains that by ""leaven of the pharisees"" jesus was simply
referring to their teaching; not sin corruption heresy.
jesus gaves his apostles the keys of the kingdom and said that
the gates of hell would not prevail against his church.

20557.eml,soc.religion.christian,"why do we follow god so blindly? have you ever asked a
physically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog?
the answer is quite simple--the dog can see, and the blind person
cannot.
i acknowledge, as a christian, that i am blind. i see,
but i see illusions as well as reality. (watched tv lately?)
i hear, but i hear lies as well as truth. (listen to your
radio or read a newspaper.) remember, all that tastes well is
not healthy. so, i rely one the one who can see, hear, and
taste everything, and knows what is real, and what is not.
that is god.
of course, you may ask, if i cannot trust my own senses,
how do i know whether what i see and hear about god is truth or
a lie. that is why we need faith to be saved. we must force
ourselves to believe that god knows the truth, and loves us
enough to share it with us, even when it defies what we think
we know. why would he have created us if he did not love us
enough to help us through this world?
i also do trust my experiences to some extent. when
i do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience,
because it is what my father commands me to do, and i see
the results in the long term, i find that he has led me
in the proper direction, even though it did not feel right
at the time. this is where our works as christians are
important: as exercises of the body make the body strong,
excercises of faith make the faith strong.
as for you, no one can ""convert"" you. you must
choose to follow god of your own will, if you are ever to
follow him. all we as christians wish to do is share with
you the love we have received from god. if you reject that,
we have to accept your decision, although we always keep
the offer open to you. if you really want to find out
why we believe what we believe, i can only suggest you try
praying for faith, reading the bible, and asking christians
about their experiences personally. then you may grow to
understand why we believe what we do, in defiance of the
logic of this world.

a half truth is at least as dangerous as a complete lie. a complete lie will
rarely be readily accepted, while a half truth (the lie subtly hidden) is more
powerfully offered by one who masquerades as an angel of light.
satan has (for some people) loosened the grip on treating the earth as something
other than god's intricate handiwork, something other than that on which the
health of future generations is based. it is being treated with respect. you
think he's going to happily leave it at that? no. when one error is rejected,
it is his style to push people to the opposite error. therefore the earth is
not god's intricate handiwork, not because it is rubbish, but because it is
god. mother earth is the one you are to primarily love and serve.
i see two facets of a response to it:
1: care for the environment. treat it with proper respect, both because it is
god's intricate handiwork and the health of future generation, and because
showing the facet of one who is disregardful of such things does not
constitute what the apostle paul called ""becoming all things to all men so
that by all possible means i might save some.""
don't say ""forget the environment, i've got important things to spend my time
on."" - putting your foot in your mouth in this manner will destroy your
credibility in expressing the things that are more important.
2: show that it is not the ultimate entity, that it is creature and not
creator. show that its beauty and glory points to a greater beauty and
glory. show that it is not the ultimate tapestry, but one of many cords
woven in the infinite tapestry. ""god, give me mountains ""but the greatest jonathan hayward to climb and the of these is love."" strength for climbing."" i corinthians 13:13"
20559.eml,soc.religion.christian,"the post is therefore immediately useless to anyone who doesn't
believe that the bible is an unadulterated truth, and to everyone
else, it is just a reaffirmation of a belief already held. as far
as i know, there is no disagreement between christians over
the resurrection of christ.
so my question is: what is the purpose of this post?

20560.eml,soc.religion.christian,"stuff deleted for brevity your very starting point is wrong. christianity is not based on following
a moral standard. ""for it is by grace you have been saved, through faith...
not by works so that no man may boast."" (eph. 2:7-8) you say that
you know the bible well, and can recognize (do you mean recite?) many
passages from memory. that could very well be so. however, it looks like
there are a few more passages that you should pay attention to. (titus 3:5
and james 2:10 are among them.)
obedience to the moral law is imporant. however, it is supposed to be the
result of turning your life over to christ and becoming a christian. it is
by no means the starting point.

20562.eml,soc.religion.christian,"i am a divorced father. chance would have it that ""my weekend"" with my
daughter has fallen upon easter weekend this year.
although i am presbyterian, i had married a catholic woman. we decided
that the catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faith
was too confining (and restrictive due to time as we had already set a
date), and we were married in a christian church which was non-denominational.
during the years of our marriage, we did not often attend church.
when our daughter was born, some years later, my wife insisted that she
be baptised as catholic. this wasn't a problem with me.
during a separation of five years, my ex-wife was taken ill with a disease
that affected her mental capacities. she was confined to a mental ward for
two months before it was diagnosed. it has since been treated ""effectively"".
in other words, professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society.
during the recuperation, my ex-wife has embraced buddism. her influence over
my daughter has been substantial, and has primarily allowed me only saturday
visitation for a number of years. during this period i have read bible study
books to my daughter, and tried to keep her aware of her christian heritage.
last fall, our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings.
at that time i was awarded visitation rights every other weekend. at that time,
i started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend.
i did this to attempt to strengthen the christian ethic and expose her to a
religious community.
today, easter sunday, i took my daughter to church. when it came time for
communion, my daughter took the bread (the body of christ) but left the wine
(the blood of christ) professing that she was too young for wine. she then
balled the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the
pew in front of us.
i feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to her
religious heritage. it can be construed as breaking several of the commandments
if you try. i really felt dishonored by the action.
my daughter is only nine years old, but i think she should have been old and
mature enough to realize her actions. i have difficulty blaming her directly
for religious teachings her mother swears to, but when i discussed this with
my daughter she made it clear she believed in buddhism and not christianity.
my initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faith
in christ then why does she celebrate easter, or christmas? i suggested i
would never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays
with her again.
i do not want to ""drive her from the fold"", and would be willing to allow her
to continue practicing buddhism (as though i had a choice seeing her only
for two days out of fourteen) but i want her to want to embrace christianity.
any suggestions?
if you have a response, please e-mail me a copy. (i'm not a regular reader
of this newsgroup.) (naturally, feel free to post too!)
thanks, and i hope you've had a happy easter.

20563.eml,soc.religion.christian,"ah, double-fulfillment. first of all i would say that i'm not sure all
the prophecies had double-fulfillment, e.g., the isaiah 7:14 prophecy.
i would say that just because this happens on some occasions does not mean
it will occur always, especially with regard to nt prophecies. the apostles
who quoted the ot and applied those passages to jesus were acting as divine
messengers and giving the inerrant word of god to the church. no one has
that authority today. no one has the apostolic authority to say that
such-and-such a prophecy has double-fulfillment. if the imagry of
revelation fits with events of the 1st century, it is folly for us to try
and make it apply to events 20 centuries later.
tom albrecht"
20564.eml,soc.religion.christian,"i think we need to distinguish etymology from meaning. regardless of
how the word 'easter' originated , the fact is that it does not now mean anything to christians other than 'the feast day of the resurrection
of jesus christ'.
the meaning of a word is only what people understand it to mean.
and the same goes for other cultural practices. the festival of easter
may possibly have some historical association with some pagan festival,
but today there are, as far as i know, no christians who intend to
honor any kind of ""pagan goddess"" by celebrating easter.
it is nonsense to say ""this word (or this practice) 'really' means so-
and-so even though nobody realizes it."" words and practices don't mean
things, people do.

things like this.)

20565.eml,soc.religion.christian,"but, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if
well- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. we are more likely
to see it as a sign , ie an action that represents grace, but which
could be replaced with other signs. in concrete terms, this means the
mass has become a commercial for god's grace rather than the real
thing. you can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn't
dare with the real thing ask coca-cola co.! . these attitudes have
been encouraged by liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing
on how to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in
liturgy. you can only create signs, symbols have to come from god or
the heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. the most dramatic
example of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of
the sacred species the consecrated host and wine . now, with pita
bread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered
in particles. if the host is a sign of grace, this isnt and issue; but
catholics in the past would have been distraught at this real
desacration of the real symbol of jesus' body.
modern catholic liturgy is caught in this epistemological shift. we
try to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac
priest get up and 'explain' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and
start pretending to do it. this is not a soul filling experience.
it doesn't help btw that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and
three chord ersatz-folk music again a result of mis-analysis: complicated
tunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the
genius of wesley and the 19c anglican hymn writers . taize' is only
slightly better.
what are we to do? well i suggest rejecting the parish system if it
doesn't work for you. search out a church where the liturgy is well
prepared not well-explained. they exist in every city. this is not btw
a matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. it is
the attitude of the church that counts. also, note that a conservative
liturgy - harking back to pre-vatican ii days, does not necessarily mean
the church will be socially conservative.
in nyc i can recommend:
corpus christi - w 12st st.
corpus christi - w 12st st. - very conservative liturgy,
st. joseph's, greenwich village. - modern, ""clean"", largely gay
oratorian church, brooklyn - very beautiful
avoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.

20567.eml,soc.religion.christian,"hmmm... people in the americas before the time of christ, children who

but of course, the popular conception of hell (correct or incorrect) is
something akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness, at the very least.
i think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond
bodily death, but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe
they're going to hell. they believe they're going to die . understand
that you've turned hell into a verb. using the same logic, it also follows
that all animals are 'going to hell.' are you sure this is what you want
to say? (presumably animals don't have the opportunity to get to heaven,
but this still doesn't change the fact that they're going to hell (die
a final death))
i don't claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of some sort, but if hell is as you described (final death, and
not eternal perpetuation of consciousness) it will be true that
there will never be a moment when i am aware of my non-existence.
(assuming i 'go to hell' and not to heaven) in other words, i'll
never know i'm dead. hmmm...
ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill, and has died:
""at least she's not suffering any more; she's in heaven now."" ?
consider the following statement:
""at least she's not suffering any more; she's in hell now.""
the above statement sounds odd, but according to your definition of hell,
it would be a true statement. the person in hell would not be suffering.
granted, they wouldn't be anything (wouldn't be having any
conscious experience whatsoever).
you say hell (death) is eternal. however, this loses its meaning
to a dead person. and to me, it seems that the threat of some sort
of eternal punishment only makes sense has force if one expects to
be conscious throughout this eternity.
many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the
product of propaganda (""friend, do you want the free gift of e-ternal life?""
it's my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife.
can anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct all
animals share. the difference is we have consciousness, and once we get the
idea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort of
super-survival.
that would depend on what heaven is like. if god is a king, and
an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the king,
i might opt for hell. i read a lovely account of a missionary trying to
convert eskimos to christianity in the book the illusion of immortality by corliss lamont. the missionary started to speak about heaven.
""are there seals in heaven? will we be able to go hunting?"" asked an
eskimo. the missionary said no. the group of eskimos then said something
to the effect of, ""well what good is your heaven if there's no hunting?
scram."" i highly recommend the above book (ioi) to anyone who wants an
account of the other side of the immortality coin (that there is no
immortality).

20568.eml,soc.religion.christian,"the answer to both questions is yes.
all scripture is true, being inspired by god. the evidence for this
claim has been discussed ad nauseum in this group.
similarly, all truth is absolute. indeed, a non-absolute truth is a
contradiction in terms. when is something absolute? when it is always
true. obviously, if a ""truth"" is not always ""true"" then we have a
contradiction in terms.
many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world. such a
statement is terribly self-contradictory. let me put it to you this
way. if there are no absolutes, shouldn't we conclude that the statement,
""there are no absolutes"" is not absolutely true? obviously, we have a
contradiction here.
this is just one of the reasons why christians defy the world by claiming
that there are indeed absolutes in the universe.
so? people sometimes disagree about what is true. this does not negate
the fact, however, that there are still absolutes in the universe. moreover,
evangelical christianity, at least, still professes to believe in certain
truths. man is sinful, man needs salvation, and jesus is the propitiation
for mankind's sins, to name a few. any group that does not profess to
believe these statements cannot be accurately called evangelical.

20571.eml,soc.religion.christian,"no one was ever flogged, beaten, burned, fed to the lions, or killed in any
other way because of a belief in the resurrection - sorry to disappoint you.
the idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different
forms in the religions of antiquity. the problem was not the resurrection
which was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the jewish population
(the saducees) but was a non issues for everyone else. the real problem was
that christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god. when the
state operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor - monotheism
becomes a capital offense. the jews were able to get exemption from this,
and were also not evangelistic. christians were far more vocal, and gentile,
and hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution. also since
christians were a relatively powerless group, they made good scapegoats as is
seen by nero's blaming them for the burning of rome. let's not cloud the
issues with the resurrection.
randy i agree with you that christians were not persecuted specifically
because they believed in resurrection. however the beliefs that did
cause trouble were dependent on belief in the resurrection of jesus.
of course the problem with it is that there are alternatives other
than a great conspiracy. the most common theory among non-christians
scholars seems to be that the resurrection was a subjective event --
in effect, a delusion. --clh"

20574.eml,soc.religion.christian,"one interpretation i've heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin
of physically abusing one's wife. the husband is usually physically
stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her.
he must honor her as his sister in christ. this would therefore be an
example of a specific sin that blocks prayer.
this verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what
is god's will for his family without consulting his wife. god reveals
his will to both the husband and the wife. there needs to be some
degree of mutuality in decision making. even those whose understanding
of the bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the
husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family.
one way to look at it is that god speaks to the wife through the husband
and to the husband through the wife.

20575.eml,soc.religion.christian,"this is certainly a valid objection to religion-as-explanation-of-
nature.
fortunately for the convenience of us believers, there is a class of
questions that can never be reduced away by natural science. for
example: why does the universe exist at all? after all, the time-space
world didn't have to exist. why does anything exist? and: is it
possible for persons (e.g. man) to come into being out of a purely
impersonal cosmos? these questions which look at the real mysteries of
life -- the creation of the world and of persons -- provide a permanent
indicator that the meaning of life in the material world can only be
found outside that world, in its source.
when you say that man is only an animal, i have to think that you are
presenting an unprovable statement -- a dogma, if you will. and one
the requires a kind of ""faith"" too. by taking such a hard line in
your atheism, you may have stumbled into a religion of your own.
but before you write off all christianity as phony and shallow, i hope
you'll do a little research into its history and varieties, perhaps by
reading paul johnson's ""a history of christianity"". from your remarks,
it seems that you have been exposed to certain types of christian
religion and not others. even an atheist should have enough faith in
man to know that a movement of 2000 years has to have some depth, and
be animated by some enduring values.

that jesus was real and that he triumphed over death.
furthermore, you say that christians hold to their beliefs ""regardless of

to support your claim, this statement is little more than an ad hominem
argument.
mind you, i don't mean this as a personal attack. i'm merely pointing out
the intellectual dishonesty behind condemning christianity in this fashion.

note that the above type of prediction does not require a god to be made.
an expert in a field can also predict things based on experience.
beware of predictions like ""the volcano will erupt tomorrow!"" don't

note also, that if i'm describing a (hypothetical) death of a friend as
a result of his passion for fast motorcycles, i might say ""his mother
predicted he would die."" of course, his father may have said ""he 'll
make good money because of his hobby"" and depending upon the final
outcome of the situation i end up mentioning the one that's
relevant. a reader down the road will get the impression that the
mother or father had predicted accurately the event, when it was just
a casual statement.
finally, on prophesies, note that there are many prophesies that can be
fulfilled my people, often to fool believers. if i say, ""beware, the
terminal will unexpectedly be shut off!"" and then after 2 secs i turn
it off (or have someone come out from another room and do it) there was
no prediction. a similar situation arises with the establishment of
the jewish state. while pressing for it, prominent jews argued that it
was predicted that they'd have a state again, and that the time has
come. (i've read this somewhere, but can't think of the source - if
you can, please let me know.) in this case, the establishment of the
state does not really fulfill the prophesy since the prophesy was used

20578.eml,soc.religion.christian,"a new religious newsgroup ""soc.religion.islam.ahmadiyya"" was pro-
posed on oct 16, 1992. the discussion about this new proposed
newsgroup went on in various related groups. the proposal, was
supposed to enter a vote during the last week of november 92. due
to a false call for votes, by some opponent, the voting had to be
canceled. i quote here a statement from the moderator of
new.announce.newgroups:
""the current call for votes (cfv) for an ahmadiyya newsgroup
is being canceled. a new call for votes will be issued within
a few weeks, possibly with a new impartial vote taker. discus-
sion on the proposal is still open until the new vote is called...""
a lot of confusion arose among the netter as to whom to vote.
therefore it was decided to give a cool down period, so that all
confusions are over. it has been over 4 months of that instant
and now we are again attempting to create this newsgroup. a fresh
rfd is hereby being issued. please! take part in the discussion
under the same title heading and in ""news.groups"" or at least
cross-post it to ""news.groups"". request for discussion name of proposed newsgroup: soc.religion.islam.ahmadiyya
charter: a religious newsgroup, which would mainly discuss the be-
liefs, teachings, philosophy and ideologies of all major reli-
gions of the world as they exist to foster better religious
knowledge and understanding among followers of all religions as
they share common basis. this newsgroup will be devoted to build
a peaceful mutual understanding of the ahmadiyya branch of
islam, its peacefull beliefs, ideology and philosophy and how it
is different from other branches of islam in fostering world
peace and developing better understanding among religious people.
it may also be used to post important religious events within the
world wide ahmadiyya islamic community in general.
purpose of the group: the following are some of the main purposes this group will
achieve:
i) to discuss the common beliefs of all major religions as
they relate to ahmadiyya muslim community.
ii) to discuss the doctrines, origin and teachings of this
puissant spiritual force on earth.
iii) to examine islamic teachings and beliefs in general in
light of the quran and established islamic traditions
of 15 centuries from ahmadiyya perspective.
iv) to discuss the similarities between ahmadi muslims and
people of other religions of the world and discuss how
religious tolerance and respect to other's faiths can
be brought about to eliminate inter-religion rivalries
and hatred among people of religions.
v) to discuss the origin and teachings of all religions in
general and islamic and ahmadiyya muslims in particular
to foster better understanding among ahmadi muslims and
other religious people.
vi) to discuss current world problems and solution to these
problems as offered by religion.
vii) to exchange important news and views about the ahmadiyya
muslim community and other religions.
viii)to add diversity in the religious newsgroups present
on usenet.
ix) to discuss why religious persecution is on the rise in
the world and find solutions to remedy the ever deter-
iorating situation in the world in general and in the
islamic world in particular.
x) to discuss the contributions of founders of all reli-
gions and their people for humanity, society and world
peace in general and by the international ahmadiyya mus
-lim community in particular.
type: the group will be moderated for orderly and free religious dialo-
gue. the moderation will not prevent disagreement or dissent to
beliefs, but will mainly be used to prevent derogatory squalid
use of dialect and irrelevant issues. the moderators have been
decided through personal e-mail and through a general consensus
among the proponants by discussion in news.groups. the following
moderators have been proposed and agreed upon:
moderator: nabeel a. rana co-moderator: dr. tahir ijaz a brief description about ahmadiyya islam: the ahmadiyya movement in islam, an international organi-
sation, was founder in 1989 in qadian, india. the founder of this
sect, hazrat mirza ghulam ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be the
promised reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the major
religions of the world today (islam, christianity, judiasm, hin-
duism). he claimed to be the long awaited second comming of
jesus christ (metaphorically), the muslim mahdi, and the promised
messiah. he claimed that the prophecies contained in almost all
the great religions of the world about the advent of a messenger
from god have been fulfilled.
the claims hazrat ahmad raised storms of hostility and
extreme oposition from many priestlike people of muslims, chris-
tians, jews and hindus of that age. such opposition is often wit-
nessed in the history of divine reformers. even today this sect
is being persecuted specially in some of the muslim regimes.
dispite the opposition and persecution, this sect has won many
adherents in 130 countries. it has over 10 million followers, who
come from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.
the sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing about
a better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli-
gions. its mission is to unite mankind into one universal broth-
erhood and develop a better understanding of faith. ahmadi
muslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe-
cially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.
among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-
tablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin-
ics in many third world countries. these institutions are staffed
by volunteer professional and are fully financed by the sect's
internal resources.
the ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral
reform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind under
one universal religion.
newsgroup creation: when the call for votes is called, the discussion will
officially end. voting will be held for about three weeks. if
the group gets 2 3rd majority and 100 more ""yes create"" votes
than ""no don't create"" votes; the group shall be created. any
questions or comments may be included in the discussion or
directly sent to:"
20579.eml,soc.religion.christian,"well, despite what my mother told me about accepting dares, here goes.
you have to be very careful about what you mean by ""question authority"".
taken literally, it is nonsense. that which is authoratative is authoratative,
and to say ""i question to word of this authority"" is ridiculous. if it is
open to question, it isn't an authority. on the other hand, it is perfectly
reasonable to question whether something is an authority. the catch phrase
here should be ""authenticate authority."" once you have authenticated
your authority, you must believe what it says, or you are not treating it as
an authority.
the difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy. you
can perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistency
in what it teaches, or by showing that it does not obey its own rules of
discourse. but the fact that i cannot discredit something does not, in
inself, accredit it. (nor does the fact that i can convince myself and
other that i have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false.)
i cannot accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings,
because if i can independantly verify its teachings, i don't need an
authority. i need an authority only when there is information i need which
i cannot get for myself. thus, if i am to authenticate an authority, i must
do it by some means other than by examining its teachings.
in practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we don't
have time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves. every scientist
woring today assumes, on the authority of the scintific community, all sorts
of knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to
verify for himself.
in spiritual matters, we accept authority because we have no direct source
ofinformation. we select our authorities based on various criteria. (i am
a catholic, in part, because the historical claims of the rc church seem
the strongest.) without authorities there would be no subject matter for
belief, unless we simply made something up for ourselves (as many do).
the atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities. this is a
reasonable assertion in itself, but it leads to a practical difficulty.
if you reject all authority out of hand, you reject all possibility of
every receiving information. thus the atheist position can never possibly
change. it is non-falsifiable and therefore unscintific.
to demand scintific or rational proof of god's existence, is to deny
god's existence, since neither science, nor reason, can, in their very
nature, prove anything. mark baker ""the task ... is not to cut down jungles, but to irrigate deserts."" -- c. s. lewis"

20581.eml,soc.religion.christian,"i am extremely uncomfortable with this way of phrasing it. god's love
is unconditional, unqualified, unfathomable. we are capable of
rejecting god's love but he never fails to love us.
these verses do not show that god's love is qualified but rather that he
is opposed to evil.
i am uncomfortable with the tract in general because there seems to be
an innappropriate emphasis on hell. god deserves our love and worship
because of who he is. i do not like the idea of frightening people into
accepting christ.
i see evangelism as combining a way of living that shows god's love with
putting into words and explaining that love. preaching the gospel
without living the gospel is no better than being a noisy gong or a
clanging cymbal.
here's a question: how many of you are christians because you are
afraid of going to hell? how many are responding to god's love?

20582.eml,soc.religion.christian,"on the one hand there are advantages to having the liturgy stay the
same. john has described some of these. on the other hand, some people
seem to start tuning out the same old words' and pay attention better
when things get changed around. i think innovative priests and liturgy
committees are trying to get our attention and make things more
meaningful for us. it drives me crazy too.
different people have differing preferences and needs in liturgy. my
local parish is innovative. i prefer to go to mass at the next parish
over. sometimes we don't have the option of attending a mass in the
style which best suits us. john put a smiley on it but to ""just offer
it up"" probably is the solution.
a related issue, that it sounds like john does not have to deal with, is
that spouses may have different liturgical tastes. my husband does like
innovative litury. it is a challenge to meet both of our spiritual
needs without just going our separate ways. when you include the factor
of also trying to satisfy our children's needs, things get pretty
complicated.
one thing to remember is that even the most uncongenial mass is still
mass.

20583.eml,soc.religion.christian,"deleted i am glad that i am not an atheist. it seems tragic that some people
choose a meaningless existence. how terrible to go on living only
because one fears death more than life. i feel so sorry for eric and

further evidence of the infectious nature of christianity.
as a christian i am free to be a human person. i think, love, choose,
and create. i will live forever with god.
christ is not a kind of drug. drugs are a replacement for christ.

20584.eml,soc.religion.christian,"the moral lesson of the story is:
the lamb of god has been sacrificed and his blood has
been used to cleanse us of our sins every moment as god perceives
worthy of being done in heaven. mary weeps for the lamb and
for the rest of her offsprings. this will continue while we
disobey god or sin against him. mary, as a messenger,
has been given the task to make us be 'aware' of the evil
serpent (communism, wars, famine, unfaithful, disobedience
to god, etc.) running after the rest of her offsprings.
the children who went astray by disobedience led by the dragon is
brought back by her peace and loving messages, reparations for sins,
to obey god's commandments and be more worthy to be in the presence
of the lamb.
as she was conceived without sin to be worthy of bearing the
son of god in her womb, mary has been preparing us, the church,
the body of christ, for his second coming (making sure we are
protected from the dragon). also, she has been preparing the new
eden, by reversing the deed of the ancient eve. the new eden will be
the sanctuary of the righteous as judged by christ in his
next coming.
i relate the story again:
i believe this and mary, in one of her apparitions
in 19th or 20th century, she appeared to these
two children who tends goats and cows (i forgot
the exact place). she was weeping and telling the
children that she is afraid she's ""going to lose her
son's arm"". she is mourning too for these
townfolks because it was their fault that there
would be drought in their harvest; not much good
food again this year as it was last year.
mary tells the children: most of the townfolks in this place worked whole week even on sundays when they should be in church honoring god. these townfolks swears and uses her son's name in bad words. that is why her son's arm is so heavy in pain.
then she asked them if they pray. the children
said ""hardly"". she asked them to pray every
morning and night. when the children went back
from work they had to tell somebody about this.
when the news was spred and after thorough investigation of the incident, the townfolks were converted and faith and obedience to god were restored in their community. once again, the lamb succeeds.

20585.eml,soc.religion.christian,"must there be a ""why"" to this? i ask because of what you also
assume about god-- namely, that he just exists, with no ""why""
to his existence. so the question is reversed, ""why can't
we assume the universe just exists as you assume god to
""just exist""? why must there be a ""why"" to the universe?""
it may be that one day man not only can create life but can also
create man. now, i don't see this happening in my lifetime,
nor do i assert it is probable. but the possibility is there,
given scientists are working hard at ""decoding"" out ""genetic
code"" to perhaps help cure disease of a genetic variation.
again, though, must there be ""why"" or a ""divine prupose"" to
man's existence?
as far as we can tell, man falls into the ""mammal"" catagory. now,
if there were something more to the man (say, a soul), then
we have yet to find evidence of such. but as it is now, man
is a mammal (babies are born live, mother gives milk, we're
warm-blooded, etc.) as other mammals are and is similar in
genetic construction to some of them (in particular, primates).
for more on this check out talk.origins.
well, then, buddhism, confucianism, taoism, hinduism, judaism,
zoerasterism, shintoism, and islam should fit this bit of logic
quite nicely... :-) all have depth, all have enduring values,
thus all must be true...

20586.eml,soc.religion.christian,"if possible (last i heard, it was out of print but they were considering
reprinting) read barbara hambly's search the seven hills . it is
historical fiction, set in rome at the time of the early church. she
captures the weirdness of the early christians and yet gives glimpses of
the holiness too. some of their odd views make a lot more sense in the
context of the society they lived in. i found it a remarkably positive
view of christianity considering that the author is not a christian
herself. another plus is that each chapter begins with an
original-source quote so that it makes a good starting point for serious
research.

20587.eml,soc.religion.christian,"if you would bother to check in any good dictioanry or thesaurus, i think
you will find that ""arrogance"" has to do with an offensive exhibition of
presumed or real superiority (a paraphrase from my own webster's).
arrognace is about pride and haughtiness. a person can believe in absolute
truth, even blindly (whatever that means) without being obnoxious about it.
just as a person can be a ""humble,"" authority-questioning,
defying-any-theist-to-reply athiest and be quite arrogant. arrogance is not
about what you believe, it is about how you relate to what you believe and
how you present it to others. if your overwhelming experience of christians
has been that they are arrogant, i apologozing both for myself and on the
behalf of those who have offfended you. but my own experience, at least in
forums like usenet where you see a good mix of people, is that arrogant
christians and athiests seems to occur in about equal numbers.

20591.eml,soc.religion.christian,"i find this argument very strange, though not unfamiliar.
an analogy someone used a while back can perhaps illustrate it.
say, for example, there are people living on a volcanic island, and a group
of geologists determine that a volcano is imminent. they warn the people on
the island that they are in danger, and should leave. a group of people on
the island is given the task of warning others of the danger.
they believe the danger is real, but others may not.
does that mean that the first group are necessarily arrogant in warning
others of the danger? does it mean that they are saying that their beliefs
are correct, and all others are false?
some might indeed react to opposition with arrogance, and behave in an
arrogant manner, but that is a personal idiocyncracy. it does not
necessarily mean that they are all arrogant. steve hayes, department of missiology editorial department

20594.eml,soc.religion.christian,"on palm sunday at our parish, we were ""invited"" to take the role of
jesus in the passion. i declined to participate. last year at the
liturgy meeting i pointed out how we crucify christ by our sins, so
therefore it is appropriate that we retain the role of the crowd, but
to no avail.
as a member of a liturgy committee, i can tell you that the problem
is certain people dominating, who want to try out all kinds of
innovations. the priests don't seem even to want to make any
decisions of their own in many cases. i guess it's easier to ""try
something new"" than it is to refuse to allow it.
at our parish on holy thursday, instead of the priests washing feet
(""who wants to get around people's feet,"" according to one of our
priests) the congregation was ""invited"" to come up and help wash one
another's hands.
the symbolism of this action distressed me, and again i refused to
participate. i thought that if we were to have to come up with
rubrics for this liturgical action (i.e. ""body of christ"" -- ""amen""
for receiving communion), that they could be ""i am not responsible for
the blood of this man.""
also for part of the eucharistic prayer (""blessed are you, god of
all creation..."") was substituted some text read by a lay couple. the
priest certainly should not have given this part of the mass over to
others, and i was so disturbed that i declined to receive communion
that night (we aren't required to anyway -- i instead offered up
prayers for our priests and parish).
the quality of the mass has not changed. again, if it were to be
celebrated according to the rubrics set down by the church, it would
still be ""liturgically"" beautiful. the problem comes about from
people trying to be ""creative"" who are not.
i think the answer to your question on participation could be that
given by father peter stravinskas in answer to the question posed by
the title of thomas day's why catholics can't sing . ""they don't
want to"" because of all this nonsense.
by the way, for any non-catholics reading this, the problem does
not reflect bad liturgy by the catholic church, but by those who are
disobedient to the church in changing it on their own ""authority.""

20595.eml,soc.religion.christian,"there has been a lot of discussion, but so far nobody seems to have hit on
exactly what the criticism of ""arrogance"" is aimed at.
the arrogance being attacked is that we ""think we are the only ones who know
what the absolutes are"". in short, many evangelicals claim that they are
infallible on the matter of religious texts.
in particular, the problem is one of epistemology. as a shorthand, you can
think of epistemology as ""how do you know?"" that question, it turns out, is
a very troubling one.
the problem with absolute certainty' is that, at the bottom, at least some of
the thinking goes on inside your own head. unless you can be certain that
everything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to
discover a source of truth is in question.
and that means you do not have absolute justification for your source of
authority -- which means you do not have absolute certainty.
let's take the specific example of biblical inerrancy, and a fictional
inerrantist named zeke. (the following arguments applies to the idea of
papal infallibility, too.)
zeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the bible, and history, and
several other topics. he has concluded, based on all these studies (and
possibly some religious experiences) that the bible is a source of absolute
truth.
he may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct.
his conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made
mistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes. his
conclusion depends on how well he studied the bible -- he may have made
mistakes. his conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made
mistakes. (noticing a common thread yet? 8-)
everything about his study of the world that he did -- everything that
happened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking. no matter what
he does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his own
infallibility. as long as any part of the belief is based on his own
reasoning, that belief cannot be considered ""absolutely certain"".
zeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief
is only as good as the quality of the search he made for it. unless he can
say that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.
any belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on
your own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop. only an infallible
thinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.
this is easy to demonstrate. let's go back to our shorthand method of doing
epistemology: ""how do you know?"" imagine a hypothetical discussion:
a: the bible is a source of absolute truth.
b: how do you know?
a: i studied history and the bible and religious writings and church
teachings and came to this conclusion.
b: how do you know you studied history correctly?
a: well, i double-checked everything.
b: how do you know you double-checked correctly?
a: well, i compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed.
b: just because some smart guy believes something that doesn't mean it is
true. how do you know they studied it correctly?
a: ...
and, as you see, b will eventually get a to the point where he has to say ""i
can't prove that there are no mistakes"" -- and as long as you may have made a
mistake, then you cannot be absolutely certain.
there is no way out of the loop.
this is where the ""arrogance of christians"" arises: many people believe
that their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the
doctrines of christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they are
infallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake.
claiming that you cannot have made a mistake, and that your thinking has led
you to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant. people who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to
find the infallibility of the church , by george salmon. he is attacking
the idea that the pope can be knowably infallible (and he does so very well),
but the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the bible is
knowably inerrant.
darren f provine ""at the core of all well-founded belief, lies belief that is unfounded."""
20596.eml,soc.religion.christian,"perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then. to me,
an absolute is something that is constant across time, culture,
situations, etc. true in every instance possible. do you agree
with this definition? i think you do:
a simple example:
in the new testament (sorry i don't have a bible at work, and can't
provide a reference), women are instructed to be silent and cover
their heads in church. now, this is scripture. by your definition,
this is truth and therefore absolute.
do women in your church speak? do they cover their heads? if all
scripture is absolute truth, it seems to me that women speaking in and
coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals.
yet, clearly, women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare
heads. (at least this was the case in the evangelical churches i grew
up in.)
evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture
to be absolute truth. (and there are plenty of other examples.)
can you reconcile this?
i don't claim that there are no absolutes. i think there are very
few, though, and determining absolutes is difficult.
but you are claiming that all of scripture is absolute. how can you
determine absolutes derived from scripture when you can't agree how
to interpret the scripture?
it's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based
on your own interpretation is absolute. do you deny that your own
background, education, prejudices, etc. come into play when you read the
bible, and determine how to interpret a passsage? do you deny that
you in fact interpret?

20597.eml,soc.religion.christian,"with this cultural background, praying ""in jesus' name"" does not
mandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the
petitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous
""fiduciary"" relationship with jesus and for the purposes of his
kingdom. the message of ""praying in jesus' name"" is thus closely
aligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about god's
delegation of kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and
responsibilities. this idea of praying ""in jesus' name"" is not only
present but prominent in the lord's prayer, although the verbal
forumula is absent.
the act of praying the words ""in jesus' name"" may be beneficial if
they cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the
advancement of god's kingdom. for that reason, i'm not quite ready
to say that the praying the formula is without meaning.
prayers to god for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving,
etc.) don't seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by
christian or non-christian, whether b.c. or a.d. (that's b.c.e. or
c.e. for you p.c. :-). i don't see anything in christ's words to
contradict the idea that god deals with all prayers according to his
omniscience and grace.

20598.eml,soc.religion.christian,"one of the things i find intersting about pagan beliefs is
their belief in a feminine deity as well as a masculine deity. being

the father, where was the mother? everyone i know who has a father
usually as a mother. it just seemed rather unbalanced to me.
fortunately, my own personal theology, which will probably not
fall into line with a lot others, recognized god as a being both
without gender and posessing qualities of both genders, as being both
a masculine and feminine force. it provides a sense of balance i find
sorely lacking in most theologies, a lack which i think is responsible
for a lot of the unbalanced ways in which we see the world and treat
each other.

certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in
spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.
that it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is
""infectious"" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides
a workable system for its adherents (and i would argue that this
is the case).
i disagree that christianity is ""a safety blanket"" which supplants
hope and purpose. rather, it points an individual to the one
source of hope and purpose. there is nothing hidden about a
christian's source for hope and purpose. of what usefulness to
you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose
and externally given hope and purpose? is the (apparent) loss of
control over one's own life the problem or is it something else?
finally, one does not appropriate ""eternal happiness"" by following
christian moral standards. indeed, the sole reason for the existance
of christianity is because standards are inadequate to save people
from their imperfections. moral standards are merely guides to the
christian; the real power to moral living is given to the christian
in the person of god's spirit.
heaven is one of two final states that
christian doctrine postulates. however, christians are generally
not motivated to live according to christian moral standards by this
promised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived
benefits to them in the here-and-now.
many christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a
priority, and rightly so (for it was jesus himself who gave this
as a priority for his followers). however, it is not the penultimate
priority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,
convert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).
rather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting
the opinions of others while demonstrating the very real benefits
of a christian lifestyle. this demonstration should be so powerful
that it compels the non-christian to seek out the christian to ask
""why?"" needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-
plished (it takes a radical committment to the person of jesus), it
does not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the christian
is required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of
friendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot
evaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or
harm others if the sole purpose of being a ""friend"" is to gain a
conversion).
as a long-time christian (nearly 20 years), i view with some skep-
ticism all evangelism programs which incorporate a ""hurry-up""
attitude. pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no
conversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s he was
coerced and disavows christianity when they would have been open
to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).
the bible states that it is the very spirit of god which brings
conviction of wrong-doing to people. i am content to do my part
(witness) and let the spirit do the rest.
we are far more than animals. we sleep, eat, reproduce, and die
just as other animals do - true. but, we are also capable of more
than this. if your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is
so limited, i can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find
a more expansive view.
(for reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing
arts that humans do? how is it that humans can learn the language
of other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so?
how is it that humans can organize themselves in various social
structures whereas other animals have only one structure?)
blatant assertion. christianity is not physically addictive.
christianity is not psychologically addictive. christianity is not
a thing which one snorts ingests shoots-up; it is a relationship
with a living being. you might as validly characterize any close-
knit relationship with this appelation.
there are ""jesus freaks"" who let the emotional aspects of worship
and christian living gain (and retain) the upper hand. even so,
this does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these
things flow.
guilty by association? that ""christianity"" which forces itself
upon another is not christianity at all.
you appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened
2000 years ago. how did you come by it?
i cannot accept your conclusion that jesus' influence was a sole
result of the roman sack of jerusalem in 70ad. he was 30 years
gone by this time. it strains the bounds of credulity to assert
that nothing about jesus' life was noteworthy until the sack.
christianity is having a relationship with jesus christ himself.
what do you know of him?

20600.eml,soc.religion.christian,"i disagree with your claim that jews were not evangelistic (except in
the narrow sense of the word). jewish proselytism was widespread.
there are numerous accounts of jewish proselytism, both in the new
testament and in roman and greek documents of the day. jim (jim eggert)"
20601.eml,soc.religion.christian,"the concept of god as a teacher is indeed interesting. does he grade on
a curve, does he cheat? that is interesting. not to mention thought
provoking. my own concept is that he is a father and we are his
children. in that he loves us, with a love that we can never understand
until we are with him. the bible says that he looks on the heart as the
final measure. from that perspective, in a grading context, the heart is
the final test.
specifically, most christians would agree that there is only one heaven
and one hell. from that perspective, it is heaven or hell. you either go
to one or the other. the ""grading"" on a pass fail basis is done by god
the father with intervention by jesus the son. not by others. for only
god sees the heart. the bible says of the heart, ""...who can know it."" i
would say there has always been, and always be, an unchanging method.
that is what makes a relationship with christ so secure. in an uncertain
and ever changing landscape he is always the same. yesterday, today and
tomorrow. concerning whether or not our childhoods are considerd as part
of the test, my own conviction is no. were that the case i certainly
wouldn't be going to heaven. the bible speaks very plainly about the
love and care jesus had for and about children. the reality is that we
are all children. some of us just have bigger bodies and grey hair. but
the father, our father is always there. like most fathers he wants only
the best for his own. there maybe decipline, but there is more love.
it's sometimes looks like christianity is a test, to see who makes it
and who doesn't. those who do pass heaven, and those who don't go to the
other place. but it is really much more than that...
there are few experts. most of us are just travelers looking for the
light and the way home. praying that we can bring others with us."
20602.eml,soc.religion.christian,"to the earlier poster who tried to support the eternal hell theory with
the fact that the fallen angels were not destroyed, remember the bible
teaches that god has reserved them until the day of judgement. their
judgement is soon to come.
let me suggest this. maybe those who believe in the eternal hell theory
should provide all the biblical evidence they can find for it. stay away
from human theories, and only take into account references in the bible.

20605.eml,soc.religion.christian,"the objection naturally is in the way in which you phrase it.
easter (or eashtar or ishtar or ishtarti or other spellings) is the pagan
whore goddess of fertility. therefore, your question to me is ""what is
the objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddess?"" when phrased
that way i suspect (or at least i would hope) that it becomes immeadiately
apparent what my objection to ""celebrating"" her would be.
no, you are thinking perhaps of ""ressurection sunday"" i think.
(though i'm not too crazy about the word ""sunday"", but i certainly like
this phrasing much better than envoking the name of the whore goddess.)
for that matter, stay biblical and call it omar rasheet (the feast of
first fruits). torah commands that this be observed on the day following
the sabbath of passover week. (sunday by any other name in modern
parlance.) why is there so much objection to observing the resurrection
on the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured? why jump it all
over the calendar the way easter does? why not just go with the sunday
following passover the way the bible has it? why seek after unbiblical
methods?
so what does this question have to do with easter (the whore
goddess)? i am all for celebrating the resurrection. just keep that
whore out of the discussion.
yes, i have heard of your newspapers speaking of the need to repave
streets with ""afro-canadiantop"". (i still think ""blacktop"" sounds
better though.)
fine by me. and while we are at it, the left-handed people are
both ""sinister"" and ""gauche"" so we probably will have some objections from
that quarter as well.
yes, that sounds much better to me. is there anyone out there would
thinks that phrasing sounds worse?
read the letter to philemon. now tell me, was philemon's ""slave""
returned to him? were there different rules upon the slave than upon
philemon? how about male and female? are there different ""rules"" that
apply to them as well? or if there is no more ""male and female"" can adam
and steve get married to each other in your congregation? yes, there are
differences in form and function. but the way we come to salvation in
messiah remains the same no matter what our position in life. i am in general not in favor of continuing this discussion, as it
seems repetitive, but this particular point is one that i believe is
new -- the objection is not to having a holiday but to its name.
i'd like to suggest that people think very carefully about this
argument. words often change their meaning over time. the days of
the week are of course originally based on pagan gods. some
christians prefer to refer to ""first day"", ""second day"", etc. however
the majority of christians have not been persuaded. the question
seems to be whether it makes any difference what the dictionary shows
as the derivation of a word, if what people mean by it and think when
they use it is different.
indeed i'd like to suggest that postings like this could themselves be
dangerous. suppose people in general use easter to mean the
celebration of christ's resurrection. postings trying to convince
them that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess run
the risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose.
they are doing their best to create a linkage in people's minds
between their celebration and the pagan goddess. it's not clear that
this is a healthy thing."
20606.eml,soc.religion.christian,"i just about closed this once before. i'm now doing so for real, after
tonight's posting."
20607.eml,soc.religion.christian,"'easter' is a pagan word all right, but it has nothing to do with ishtar.
if 'easter' and 'ishtar' were related, their history would show it.
but in old english, easter was 'eostre', cognate with english 'east'
and german 'ost'. the reconstructed proto-germanic form is 'austron'.
not until after 1400 did 'easter' have a high front vowel like 'ishtar'.
clearly, the two words have quite separate origins.
there may be neo-pagans who worship ishtar at easter, but if so, they
are making either a mistake of etymology, or a deliberate play on words.

:
in fact, that is the reason easter ""jumps all over the calendar""- passsover
itself is a lunar holiday, not a solar one, and thus falls over a wide
possible span of times. the few times that easter does not fall during or
after passover are because easter is further linked to the vernal equinox-
the beginning of spring. more deletions :
: so what does this question have to do with easter (the whore

:
your obsession with the term ""whore"" clouds your argument. ""whore"" is
a value judgement, not a descriptive term. more deletions overall, this argument is an illustration of the ""etymological fallacy""
(see j.p. louw: semantics of nt greek ). that is the idea that the true
meaning of a word lies in its origins and linguistic form. in fact, our
own experience demonstrates that the meaning of a word is bound up with
how it is used , not where it came from. very few modern people would
make any connection whatsoever between ""easter"" and ""ishtar."" if daniel
seagard does, then for him it has that meaning. but that is a highly
idiosyncratic ""meaning,"" and not one that needs much refutation."

20615.eml,soc.religion.christian,"yes, i do agree with your definition. my use of the term ""always"" is
rather deceptive, i admit.
hold it. i said that all of scripture is true. however, discerning
exactly what jesus, paul and company were trying to say is not always so
easy. i don't believe that paul was trying to say that all women should
behave that way. rather, he was trying to say that under the circumstances
at the time, the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility and
cover their heads. this has to do with maintaining a proper witness toward
others. remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derived
from absolutes. for instance, it is absolutely right for christians to
strive for peace. however, this does not rule out trying to maintain world
peace by resorting to violence on occasion. (yes, my opinion.)
sure. the bible preaches absolute truths. however, exactly what those
truths are is sometimes a matter of confusion. as i said, the bible does
preach absolute truths. sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal
clear (at least to evangelicals). sometimes they are not so clear to
everyone (e.g. should baptism be by full immersion or not, etc). that is
largely because sometimes, it is not explicitly spelled out whether the writers
are speaking to a particular culture or to christianity as a whole. this is
where scholarship and the study of biblical contexts comes in.
god revealed his truths to the world, through his word. it is utterly
unavoidable, however, that some people whill come up with alternate
interpretations. practically anything can be misinterpreted, especially
when it comes to matters of right and wrong. care to deny that?

someone pops up on alt.atheism to tell us all about his (usually
atheistic) beliefs, so i can certainly see how christians might be
annoyed- but i'd like to point out a few things.
""no meaning from god"" is not the same as ""no meaning"". from my (atheistic)
point of view, if you want meaning in your life, you get to go and
get some or make some.
no free gifts of meaning. (i never quite understood how any
god can just ""give"" your life meaning, actually. if he
says you exists to do or be x, that gives you a purpose
if you care to accept it, but is that the same thing? but
i digress...)
this would truely be a miserably existance, which i doubt eric
endures. life can be enjoyable, so you can live it because you like
it, or purposefull, so you can live it to get something done. one should
endeavour to make it so, if it is not. otherwise it would be as you say.
terrible.
probably true. remeber he almost certainly sees that particular joy as
an illusion, and does not want it. so maybe it isn't so bad?
as an atheist, i am free to be a human person. i think, love, choose,
and create.
ah, now here we begin to diverge. i will not live forever
with anyone.
(i don't think you will either, but you are welcome to your
opinion on the matter.)
i tend to agree with you.
it's my opinion that (unlike drugs) religions are normal
parts of human societies.
i think they have outlived their usefullness, but they
are evidently quite ordinary, normal things that haven't
proved lethal to humanity yet.
i have heard this claim quite a few times. does anybody here know
who first came up with the ""god-shaped hole"" business?
you might want to provide some evidence next time you make a claim
like this.
i don't know eric, but i do not think it is wise to assume he has a less
joy-filled and abundant life because he holds certain beliefs.

non-christian; they are a way of ending the lenten fast.)
my point was to distinguish between
(1) intentionally worshipping a pagan deity, and
(2) doing something which may once have had pagan associations, but
nowadays is not understood or intended as such.
many people who are doing (2) are being accused of (1).
it would be illogical to claim that one is ""really"" worshipping a
pagan deity without knowing it. worship is a matter of intention.
one cannot worship without knowing that one is doing so.

20623.eml,soc.religion.christian,"first of all, i resent your assumption that you know why i
am threatened by science, or even that i am threatened at all,
although i admit the latter. the reason i am threatened by science
has nothing to do with my need for proof of my lord's existence--
god reveals himself in many ways, including, to some degree,
science.
my problem with science is that often it allows us to
assume we know what is best for ourselves. god endowed us
with the ability to produce life through sexual relations,
for example, but he did not make that availible to everyone.
does that mean that if science can over-ride god's decision
through alterations, that god wills for us to have the power
to decide who should and should not be able to have
children? should men be allowed to have babies, if that
is made possible.
people have always had the ability to end lives
unnaturally, and soon may have the ability to bring lives
into the world unnaturally. the closest thing to artificially
created life is artificially created death, and as god
has reserved judgement about when people should die to
himself, i believe we should rely on god's wisdom about how
people should be brought in to the world.
this is not to say that i reject all forms of
medical treatment, however. treatment that alleviates
pain, or prevents pain from occuring, is perfectly
acceptable, i believe, as it was acceptable for jesus
to cure the sick. however, treatment that merely
prolongs life for no reason, or makes unnecessary
alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes,
go too far. are we not happy with the beauty god
gave us?
i cannot draw a solid line regarding where i
would approve of scientific study, and where i would not,
but i will say this: before one experiments with the
universe to find out all its secrets, one should ask
why they want this knowledge. before one alters the body
they have been given, they should ask themseles why their
body is not satisfactory too them as it is. i cannot
make any general rules that will cover all the cases, but
i will say that each person should pray for guidance
when trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, and
should cease their unravelling if they have reason to
believe their search is displeasing to god."
20624.eml,soc.religion.christian,"the last sentence is ironic, since so many readers of
soc.religion.christian seem to not be embarrassed by apologists such as
josh mcdowell and c.s. lewis. the above also expresses a rather odd sense
of history. what makes you think the masses in aquinas' day, who were
mostly illiterate, knew any more about rhetoric and logic than most people
today? if writings from the period seem elevated consider that only the
cream of the crop, so to speak, could read and write. if everyone in
the medieval period ""knew the rules"" it was a matter of uncritically
accepting what they were told.
bill mayne this may be unfair to lewis. the most prominent fallacy attributed
to him is the ""liar, lunatic, and lord"". as quoted by many
christians, this is a logical fallacy. in its original context, it
was not. --clh"
20625.eml,soc.religion.christian,"i heard the same thing, but without confirmation that he actually said it.

should rape everything in sight just before."
20626.eml,soc.religion.christian,"i agree with carol here. determining absolutes is, practically speaking, a
waste of time. and we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative.
for example, i recently was asking some children the question ""what temperature
does water boil at?"" i got the answer 212 degrees consistently. i asked
if they knew what scale, and was told ""it's just 212 degrees. any scale.
that's what all thermometers say."" well, that's sincere, and may be
true in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong. it is not
an absolute truth. similarly, scripture is full of truth, which we should
nurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are absolute truth
and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time
and culture in which the text was penned is missing the point. then religion
easily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of
the indwelling trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, imo. example of head-covering in church deleted this was a good example. there may be an absolute truth behind the
writing, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the
instructions apply to the corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere.
the instructions may reflect absolute truth in the context of first
century culture and the particular climate at corinth, which was having
a lot of trouble with order. is it absolute truth to me? no. and i
see no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be.
even the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the bible literally.
i've yet to meet anyone who takes the verse ""blessed is he who takes your
babies and smashes their heads against the rocks"" literally. the bible
was not printed or handed to us by god with color codings to tell us
what parts should be interpreted which way.
i agree. very few. and even if we knew them, personally, we may not be
able to express that in a way that still conveys absolute truth to another.
the presence of absence of absolutes may not make any difference, since i
know i can never fully apprehend an absolute if it walks up and greets me.
i can't prove the existence of absolutes. i can only rely upon my experience.
i also trust god's revelation that we cannot fully comprehend the infinite.
therefore we can't comprehend the absolutes. so i don't need them.
i can never know the essence of god, only the energies by and through which
god is manifested to god's creation. so the reality can be that there are
absolutes, but it is of no practical importance. it's like claiming that the
original scriptural autographs were perfect, but copies may not be. swell.
who cares? it doesn't affect me in any practical useful way. i might as
well believe that god has made a lot of electric blue chickens, and that they
live on mars. maybe god did. so what? is that going to have any effect on
how i deal with my neighbor, or god? whether or not i go to this or that
cafeteria for lunch? no.
this attitude leads many non-christians to believe that all christians
are arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning. christianity is true,
wonderful and sensible. it appeals to reason, since reason is an inner
reflection of the logos of god. explanations that violate that simply
appear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world.
note: i'm not claiming there is no place for authority. that'd be silly.
there is a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian.
authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others.
authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that,
and is generally agressive. good parents (like god) are authoritative.
many christians are simply authoritarian, and, not surprisingly, few
adults respond to this treatment.

20627.eml,soc.religion.christian,"the discussion begins: why does the universe exist at all? must there be a ""why"" to this? i ask because of what you also assume about god-- namely, that he just exists, with no ""why"" to his existence. so the question is reversed, ""why can't we assume the universe just exists as you assume god to ""just exist""? why must there be a ""why"" to the universe?""
one of the laws of nature, specifying cause and effect seems to dictate
(at least to this layman's mind) there must be a causal event. no
reasonable alternative exists.
as far as i can tell, the very laws of nature demand a ""why"". that isn't
true of something outside of nature (i.e., super natural). ... it may be that one day man not only can create life but can also create man. now, i don't see this happening in my lifetime, nor do i assert it is probable. but the possibility is there, given scientists are working hard at ""decoding"" out ""genetic code"" to perhaps help cure disease of a genetic variation. again, though, must there be ""why"" or a ""divine prupose"" to man's existence?
i believe the ""genetic code"" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes,
but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining,
reproducing life, ever . (i've never been much of a prophet, though. i
can't even picture new york in my mind 8 ). i don't believe any technology would be able to produce that necessary spark of life, despite
having all of the parts available. just my opinion. when you say that man is only an animal, i have to think that you are presenting an unprovable statement -- a dogma, if you will. and one the requires a kind of ""faith"" too. by taking such a hard line in your atheism, you may have stumbled into a religion of your own. as far as we can tell, man falls into the ""mammal"" catagory. now, that preposition sort of precludes an absolute, doesn't it? without an
absolute conclusion, what are we left with? i believe the word ""faith""
works nicely. if there were something more to the man (say, a soul), then we have yet to find evidence of such. but as it is now, man is a mammal (babies are born live, mother gives milk, we're warm-blooded, etc.) as other mammals are and is similar in genetic construction to some of them (in particular, primates). for more on this check out talk.origins. but before you write off all christianity as phony and shallow, i hope you'll do a little research into its history and varieties, perhaps by reading paul johnson's ""a history of christianity"". from your remarks, it seems that you have been exposed to certain types of christian religion and not others. even an atheist should have enough faith in man to know that a movement of 2000 years has to have some depth, and be animated by some enduring values. well, then, buddhism, confucianism, taoism, hinduism, judaism, zoerasterism, shintoism, and islam should fit this bit of logic quite nicely... :-) all have depth, all have enduring values, thus all must be true...
well then, with an equal scale, and under an equal standard, investigate
them all, and discover where god is ( or whether he is, for the denial of
god is ultimately a statement of faith, non-falsifiable as his existence
may be).
for isn't this the purpose of religion - to discover, and in discovery, to know god?
you don't mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your
research, do you? after all, if we of christ are deluding ourselves, you
really have nothing to worry about, eh?

guns (6,350 total attacks) 12.2
source: firearms and violence in american life
it might be contended that if gun murderers were deprived of guns
that they would find a way to kill as often with knives. if this were
so, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide
would be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in
cities where guns were not so widely used (like vancouver) would show
a higher fatality rate. but the nat'l commission on the causes and
prevention of violence task force analyzed the data and found this
not to be the case. it appeared to them that as the number of knife
attacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks
(which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants),
the proportion of fatal knife attacks did not increase relative to the
proportion of gun attacks. in fact, the reverse was true.
what was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on
the part of the assailant to kill. fatalities caused by knife tended
to show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave
physical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the
head neck and chest, etc. most gun homicides did not show this
pattern. rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of
rage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.

there are a lot of factors which make a difference. actually, i'm not
fond of making any kind of social parallels between europeans and
americans. there are more cultural, beahvioral and economic
differences between us than similarities. i just sort of found
myself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks. i
don't think we could ever attain the low levels of european violent
crime here in the us, whether we banned guns or required every
law-abiding citizen to carry a loaded uzi.
on the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more
culturally similar, namely the canadians. in fact, an exhaustive,
seven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates
of vancouver, british columbia and seattle, washington... cities
with roughly the same population, urban economy, geography
and crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.
in seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense. after
a 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed
weapon. the recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.
in vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason
to purchase a handgun. concealed weapons are not permitted.
recreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are
regulated by the province. purchase of a handgun requires a
restricted-weapons permit. a permit to carry may be obtained in
order to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs. handguns
transported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box.
in short, gun control but not unreasonably so.
both cities aggressively enforce their gun laws. convictions for
gun-related offenses carry similar penalties. the researchers
studied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated),
burglary and homicides occurring in seattle and vancouver from
1 1 80 to 12 31 86. in defining the cases, they used the same
standard: the fbi's unified crime report.
results: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in
seattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in vancouver
(1.09 1.11). burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99).
18,925 assaults were recorded in seattle versus 12,034 in
vancouver. the risk of being a victim of a simple assault in
seattle was found to be only slightly higher than vancouver (1.18 1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher
(1.16 1.12). however, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by
weapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged.
although both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated
assault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were
far more likely to be used in seattle. in fact, 7.7 times as often.
over the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in seattle
(11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in vancouver (6.9 per 100,000).
after adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations,
the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in seattle, as
compared to vancouver, was found to be 1.63.
when homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate
of homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in
seattle was found to be almost identical to that in vancouver.
virtually all of the increased risk of death in seattle was due to
a more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms. handguns
accounted for roughly 85 of homicides involving firearms. handguns
were 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in seattle than
in vancouver.
the authors of the report also investigated ""legally justifiable""
homicides (self-defense). only 32 such homicides occurred during
the seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police. only
21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in
seattle and 4 in vancouver. only 13 involved firearms. after
excluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these
earlier findings.
this is, i feel, a very fair report. one might even make the
argument that it is biased against canada as a whole because
vancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times
that of ottawa, calgary and toronto while seattle reports
annual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of nyc,
chicago, los angeles and houston.
critics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access
to handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because
persons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a
gun or will kill by other means. this report shows differently.
if the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by
the strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we
could expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to
be higher in vancouver than in seattle. however, during the study
interval, vancouver's rate of homicide by weapons other than guns
was not significantly higher than that in seattle, suggesting that
few would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.
as well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding
citizens was not endorsed in this report. although seattle did
experience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these
cases accounted for less than 4 of the homicides in both cities
during the course of the study period. and, as was reported,
seattle apparently didn't enjoy relief from any crime category
over vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for
self-defense.

53296.eml,talk.politics.guns,"dear sir:
by now, we are used to the new england journal of medicine's publication
of small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are
drawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of
momentus ""scientific"" findings. these are regularly released to the press
without the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and
often accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings.
generally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however
meaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle
serious studies by criminologists.
the latest effort -- ""handgun regulations, crime, assaults, and homicide:
a tale of two cities,"" by j.h. sloan, et al., with the accompanying
editorial, ""firearms injuries: a call for science,"" by two employees
of the centers for disease control (november 10), however, is an insult
to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few
data and so many flaws that i feel compelled to write at some length
to call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular
order.
1. the authors misleadingly cite wright, et al. (ref. 1) to
support the statement that ""some have argued that restricting
access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate
of homicide."" wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that
contention.
2. the authors pretended that vancouver and seattle are very
similar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,
demographic characteristics, and the like. in fact, the cities
are very different with very different demographic characteristics
which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in
seattle. both cities are over three-forths non-hispanic white
and the non-hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be
the same in seattle and vancouver . it is the different back-
grounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various
ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.
3. the authors pretend they are evaluating canada's gun law,
compared to washington state's. but they do not examine at all
the situation in vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect
in 1978. as it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-
1977), vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth
involving handguns, (ref. 2) and in the seven years of the nejm
article there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving
handguns. surely even the medical profession recognizes that
one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding
that a change made a difference? would a physician conclude that
a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day
for seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without
at least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?
4. the authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national
gun law. nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily
selected sample. seattle appears to have been selected because
it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific
reason. would physicians call something a scientific study which
involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar ""control""?
had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite
""scientific"" conclusions would follow: vancouver's homicide
rate exceeds that of such ""wild west"" cities in texas as
el paso, corpus christi, austen, and, in colorado, colorado
springs. (ref. 3)
5. the authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or
handguns ""are far more commonly owned in seattle than in
vancouver."" they use two surrogate approaches in pretending
to study the availability of firearms handguns. the first is
an apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry
permits in seattle to the number of registered handguns in
vancouver. but the number clearly understates the number of
handguns in seattle, and counts primarily protective handgun
owners. the second, however, tells nothing about the number
of handguns in vancouver, and counts non-protective handguns
for the most part. where is it difficult to obtain handguns
legally for protection, registration figures are
meaningless. there are 66,000 registered handguns in new york
city (new york daily news, sept. 27, 1987). comparing the two,
that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population
in new york city compared to 960 in vancouver, meaning vancouver
has a greater ""prevalence of weapons"" than new york city.
the second method of measuring gun density is ""cook's gun
prevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity
differences."" but the validation was by cook of his own
theory. (ref. 4) normally, second opinions are sought from a
different doctor. more significantly, the cook index is
based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement
in suicide and homicide. so the authors are basically taking
a measure of misuse. unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide
(42 in seattle, 14 in vancouver) is related to gun misuse in
homicide plus suicide, divided by two (41 in seattle, 12 in
vancouver). the authors are not measuring the relative avail-
ability of firearms, or of handguns, in seattle and
vancouver.
6. the authors misstate the laws of both washington and
canada. they neglect to mention the significant fact that
washington has a waiting period and background check prior to
the purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in canadian
law for owning and carrying handguns for personal
protection. the authors also make it appear that it is more
difficult to get a handgun legally in canada than is actually
the case.
7. the authors ignore all other factors which might explain
the differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the
penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of
clearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a
firearm. there is no measure of: the differences in the number
of law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making
arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest
rates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences
imposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,
or gun law violations; or incarceration rates. whereas social
scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,
the authors of the nejm ""tale of two cities"" fail even to mention
most factors related to crime control.
8. the authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective
means for protection unless the criminal is killed. such is not
the case. criminologists (ref. 5-8) have found that almost
650,000 americans annually use handguns for protection from
criminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the
liklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be
completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury
to the victim. it is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors
reported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides
without firearms in each city but that less restrictive seattle
accounted for 100 of the reported civilian justifiable homicides
involving firearms.
9. the centers for disease control, which funded the ""study,""
editorially praised the paper, (ref. 9) saying it ""applied
scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb
advocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly
handguns."" there is nothing in the paper which could possibly
be mistaken for ""scientific methods"" by a sociologists or
criminologists. the vancouver-seattle ""study"" is the equivolent
of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding
two ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25
and the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,
administering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while
giving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure
and, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure,
announcing in a ""special article"" a new medical breakthrough.
it would be nice to think that such a ""study"" would neither be
funded by the cdc or printed by the nejm.
since the longstanding anti-gun biases of the nejm and the cdc
make them willing to present shoddy research as ""scientific
breakthroughs"" in ""special articles"" and editorials relating
to firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying
the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight
over the activities of the centers for disease control about
the distortions contained in ""handgun regulations, crime, assaults,
and homicides: a tale of two cities"" and ""firearm injuries: a call
for science."" clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside
whenever the cdc and the new england journal of medicine seize
an opportunity to attack firearms ownership in america.

(from july 1989 issue of reason, free minds free markets)
suggestive, but what they conceal is vital."" the problem is demonstrated
by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting
to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide. funded by
the federal government and published last year in the new england journal
of medicine, the study compared homicide rates in seattle and vancouver and
suggested that a handgun ban ""may reduce the rate of homicide in a
community.""
the nine medical doctors who published ""handgun regulations, crime,
assaults, and homicide"" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) despite
many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) vancouver
has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations
make guns less available. the second step in their reasoning seems
indisputable. the overall homicide rate in seattle (for the period
1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in vancouver.
homicide is definitely more common in seattle. the question then becomes,
why?
the authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case
to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,
that vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent. but their
evidence on the difference in gun availabilty is indirect and
unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point
does not exist. they offer two fragments of inferential data in support
of the claim that guns are more available in seattle; but for all anybody
knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true. we
are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that
a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates
when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.
indeed, the situation is even more troublesome. the first of the two
indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-
weapons permits issued in seattle and the number of restricted-weapons
permits issued in vancouver. differences between the two cities in the
permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable. the second bit of evidence is ""cook's gun prevalence index,"" which stands at 41 percent for seattle but only 12 percent for vancouver. cook's index however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in various cities. it measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage of homicides and suicides involving firearms. in the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides, firearms are more likely to be used in seatte than in vancouver. to take cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides is directly related to their relative availability in the general population. but this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. to assume what one is seeking to prove, then to ""prove"" it on the basis of that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.
even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that
guns are less common in vancouver, we might still question what causes what.
the authors attribute seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun
ownership. but it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates
reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,
that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.
in fact, it was once commonly argued that great britain's low rate of
violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the
consequent low rate of gun ownership--until british researcher colin
greenwood found that great britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime
for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted. to invoke
an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.
nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data
on gun ownership. the authors say seattle and vancouver are ""similar in
many ways,"" implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law
stringency, and crime rates. this is an evident attempt to establish
the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that ""all
else is equal"" among things being compared. clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime or homicide rates. the cities are closely matched in what percentage of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent). but seattle is about 10 percent black, while vancouver is less than 0.5 percent. vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly asian. so although the authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half- dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out. in fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates according to the race of the victim. for the white majority, the homicide rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in seattle, 6.4 in vancouver. the differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities. for blacks, the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for hispanics 26.9 to 7.9. (methodoligical complexities render the asian comparison problematic, but it too is higher in seattle than in vancouver.) racial minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in seattle than in vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain in either city.
since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the
cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority
groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in ""gun availability""
(or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not
matter at all to whites. can differential gun availability explain why
blacks and hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed
in seattle than in vancouver? (studies in the united states, incidentally,
do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)
or are other explanations more plausible? could the disparity between
canadian and american rates of poverty among racial minorities have
anything to do with it? what are the relative rates of drug or alcohol
abuse? of homelessness among each cty's minority population? (the city
of seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the
mississippi.) unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the
united states usually exceeds 40 percent. what is the comparable canadian
percentage?
the crucial point is that canada and the united states differ in many
ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries. absent
more detailed analysis, nearly any of these ""many ways"" might explain part
or all of the difference in homicide rates. in gross comparisons such
as those between seattle and vancouver, all else is not equal. the authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide result in a ""complex picture."" they do not acknowledge that the ensuing complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument. they also acknowledge that ""socio-economic status is probably an important confounding factor in our comparison,"" remarking further that ""blacks in vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of vancouver's population."" given the evidence presented in the article, it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between seattle and vancouver results from greater proverty among seattle's racial minorities. but the authors pay no further attention to this possibility, since ""detailed information about household incomes according to race is not available for vancouver.""
the largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in
gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple
example. if one were to take all u.s. couties and compare them in terms
of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one
would find an astonishing pattern: counties with more guns have less crime.
would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce
crime? or would one insist that other variables also be taken into
account? in this example, the ""hidden variable"" is city size: guns are
more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city
problem. if researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the
appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very
seriously misled. in the study at hand, the authors matched two cities
for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,
and their results are impossible to interpret.
in the editorial ""firearm injuries: a call for science"" accompanying
the study, two officials from the centers for disease control lauded the
authors for applying ""scientific methods"" to a problem of grave public
heath significance. but in attempting to draw causal conclusions from
nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate
plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them
out. absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are
little more than polemics masquerading as serious research. that this
study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical
identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--
is cause for further concern. james d. wright is professor of sociology at tulane university. he has

and it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit part

suggest that the loss of 4 atf agents is inconsequential in this the

might be that the atf denied their agents (street stories report) requests

feb 25th - nj assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban.
feb 28th - compound in waco attacked.
on feb. 25th the new jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon
ban in that state. it looked like it might be a tight vote, but the senate
in n.j. was going to vote to overturn the ban. it would not sit well to have
an eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban, given clintons stated
agenda on gun control. i suspect clinton gave the order to get someone or some
group with assualt weapons and have the press present (they were initially
at the incident in waco) to record the event for the tv audience. the agent
on ""street stories"" reported that a supervisor was urging them all to ""get
ready fast"", as ""they know we are coming"". i believe this attack continued,
even tho the probablility of failure was high, because it came from the top

the united states than england. in terms of laws regarding individual
rights, restrictions on police searches, etc... (all closely
related to crime) canadian laws parallel england's and differ
greatly from those of the united states.
actually, they do not have ""roughly the same... urban economy"",
and extremely different ethnic composition.
however, if you account for economic and ethnic differences,
the difference disappears completely: seattle's minorities are
predominatly poor, while vancouver's are middle or upper class.
the rates for whites in both cities were found to be identicle,
while the rate for poor, seattle minorities was almost three
times as great as for the well-to-do minorities of vancouver.
the pattern seems to be one of poverty and race relations, not
one of gun control.
that is a gross distortion: ""self-defense"" does not mean killing
the attacker. there were 21 cases of civilians killing their
attacker in self-defence. but such cases represent less that
0.5 of the crimes prevented by armed self-defence; for every
case you cite, there were over 200 other cases of self-defence
where the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed.
(0.5 , by the way, is the most conservative possible figure,
based on the national crime survey's estimate of 80,000
crimes prevented by armed self-defence each year. most other
studies on the subject put the figure at 500,000 to 600,000.
those figures would imply less than 0.08 of sucessful self-defences
involve killing the attacker.)
so, more correctly, there over 4000 (possibly as many as 25,000)
cases of civilians acting in self-defence, only 21 of which resulted
in the death of the attacker. this is a significant factor, in
comparison to the 592 homicides. if memory serves, homicides
make up approximately 1 of the violent crimes the study
considered, so the fair comparison would be 40 - 250 homicides
prevented and 592 homicides. clearly, the study can not be
close to accurate, since it ignored these cases of self-defence.

nuclear weapons in and of themselves are dangerous. radioactive

defense purposes. it's kinda hard to justify their use as
a militia weapon when at best they are meant for battlefield use
(low-yield weapons) or at worst for industrial target obliteration

for it to be used as a militia weapon and expect the user to live

aaron"
53322.eml,talk.politics.guns,"no. the issue is reducing crime, not guns. if gun control doesn't
lower crime overall, then is doesn't address the issue.
does that matter if assaults with a baseball bat become much
more common? muggers using a gun rely primarily on the
threat of the gun, and rarely shoot their victim. a mugger
using a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim
in an effort incapacitate him. so, while a knif may not
be as deadly as a gun, criminals are more likely to actually use the knife (as opposed to threatening the victim with it.)
it isn't at all clear that replacing the criminal's gun with a
knife would reduce murders. stabbings might just become more
common. that's why it is important to look at the overall
(not the with-gun) homicide rate. it avoids the issue of
substitution, different criminal techinques of using different
weapons, etc... and measures what we want to prevent: murders.
""face""? possibly. however, facing knife-welding attackers isn't
too common: stabbing without warning and by supprise is the
usual tactic. very few criminals shoot from cover: it attracts
to much attention and they don't have a chance to go through your
pockets. overall, i'd much rather be threatened with a gun
than actually stabbed with a knife.
actually, the exact same statement is true of guns: training in
unarmed self-defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman
without much problem.
you also ignore the criminal's reaction: the national crime
survey clearly shows that criminals (unarmed, armed with a
knife, gun or whatever) are unwilling to risk their lives
in a confrontation. if faced with a serious threat, almost
all prefer to leave and find an easier target. therefore,
using (or threatening to use, as is much more commonly the case)
a weapon is the best defence against an attacker, regardless
of how he is armed. knives, however, are much less effective
than guns: criminals don't consider knifes as a ""serious threat""
nearly as often as they do guns.

53323.eml,talk.politics.guns,"i don't think anyone is arguing that there would be no effect. but
there would be no net positive effect. you also have to
consider the negative side: law abiding citizens, armed with
fireamrs (pistols for the most part), prevent between 80,000
(national crime survey) and 1,000,000 (dr. kleck) crimes
each year. (those are the extremes. most studies find
the number to be 500,000 to 600,000.) about 1 of those crimes are
homicides, so private ownership of firearms saves approximately
5,000 lives each year. there are roughly 12,000 criminal homicides
and fatal accidents involving guns each year. for there to
be any net benefit, you would have to show that gun control measures
would disarm over 40 of the criminals currently using guns.
that would be very hard to do: according the the federal batf,
only 8 of criminals buy their guns over the counter. since
gun control laws, by their very nature, only effect legal
sales, such a law would remove all the benefits of armed,
law-abiding citizens while having only a minimal effect on
armed criminals (who, by and large, get their guns illegally.)
that doesn't sound like a net benefit to me.
since most were with licensed weapons, i assume you are not
supporting ""reasonable"" laws (i.e. waiting periods, background
checks, licenses, etc...). since only a complete ban would
alter the statistic you refer to, i assume that's what you
are supporting.
by the way, 1135 people dies in 1986 from falling down stairs.
250 accidental handgun deaths isn't significant next to
other household accidents.
1080 children under the age of 10 died by drowning, 69 from
drinking poisonous household chemicals (like drano), 139 from
falls. if the real goal is to reduce the tragic, accidental
deaths of children, wouldn't a ban on drain cleaners be a
better palce to start? (or, perhaps, restricting ownership to
professionals like plumbers?)
while you might call it ""emphasis"", refering to completely two
statistics in the same sentence implies a comparison. if it
isn't valid, and you put the numbers together to convince people
you are right, the kindest thing i could call it is propaganda.

actually, why bother looking it up? from the material we covered last

available chemicals in the garage if i felt like. the electronics
behind the detonator and the shaped charges are a little trickier,

53358.eml,talk.politics.guns,"but whatever the neutrons hit has a good chance of absorbing the
neutron and becoming radioactive itself. mostly, that means water
turning into (harmless) heavy water. but some neutrons would
also hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives
would remain in the body for decades. i think an unshielded nuclear
warhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.
as for a shielded warhead, i think a fair amount of maintaince
is required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in
a dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) for private
ownership to be unregulated, i think a single individual must
be able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe
condition. if any random private citizen could not properly
keep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation
is clearly appropriate.
i disagree with this purpose: the job of the militia is to defend
themselves and their community. if you look at the american
revolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves
from, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. they
didn't overthrow it, and those communities (canada and england, for
example) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same
old regime. if the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and
destroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons might be appropriate.
but their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suited
for that.
there is also the question of personal and collective arms: the
second amendment definately protects ownership of personal
weapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members
to provide their own arms.) but it isn't clear if it covers
other arms. certainly, not all members would supply (for example)
a tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively)
should. however, those providing the heavy weapons have a
disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower.
the militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely
democratic: if only 50 of the members supported the cause, only
50 would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower would
be proportionately reduced. militia firepower and the popular
will were, therefore, linked. but if a small minority of the
members supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the
form of heavy weapons) this would all change: the militia's
firepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not
of the general public. worse, that minority would be quite
different from the general public (at the very least, they
would be much richer.) as a result, i think the nature and
character of the militia requires that each member provide
a roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: his personal
weapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.

sometimes patrolled by the wermacht, but they were certainly not in control.
there were two major native factions opposing each other and the germans,
it was basically useless to the germans (no production) and a drain on their
resources (a armored division and a couple of infantry divisions) which if
my memory is correct, were kind of stuck there up until the allies accepted
their surrender. (i think that the allies also let the germans keep some
of their weapons for self defense unitil they were able to get to the
lowlands, away from the resistance factions. this is from memory, and
it is unreliable."

54117.eml,talk.politics.guns,"letter to a liberal colleague author's note: ""adrian"" -- name changed to protect the guilty --
and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with
the same editor at a famous new york publishing house. dear adrian:
i'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to
your note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview i gave and
generally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist
mostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) i can back
with evidence and logic i've neither time nor energy to present
now. i've written fully on this topic before and will again in the
future. when i do, i'll make sure you get copies.
there are many arguments i might make, from the futility and danger
of delegating self-defense to the police (see don kates in the jan.
10, 1985 wall street journal) to the real effect of prohibition,
shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic
rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but i'll
limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent
with your note.
first, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and
constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.
second, publication of some latter-day ""scientific study"" doesn't
alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists i discussed in my
interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.
third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and
constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.
fourth, as often happens with these things, the ""study"" doesn't
support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions
anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older
body of lies, omissions, and distortions.
fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and
constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.
sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on
countless occasions (carl bakal, author of no right to keep and
bear arms, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this
present ""study"" dubious, to say the least.
seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is
a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,
and constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic
process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.
eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat
(not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you
should be better aware than most people how ""progress"" -- in
designing ""studies"" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our
ability to collect meaningful data. a case in point we might agree
on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30
years to create ""studies"" ""proving"" that pornography causes crime.
more naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s
clearly indicate the contrary.
ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and
constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.
tenth, another reason to doubt all such ""studies"" is that human
behavior (as the austrian school of economics demonstrates) is far
too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified. the
attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the
resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.
eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is
a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,
and constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic
process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.
twelfth, the ""study"" is also worthless because it incorporates
figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but
basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social
benefits. if anything, perhaps suicide intervention should be a
criminal offense.
thirteenth and finally, the national rifle association officials
quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are
many), are correct in this instance: the ""study"" is meaningless
because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and
constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.
and because of that, adrian, even if the ""study"" were valid, it
wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that
anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however,
whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's
permission. in this i'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists
themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed
people to go out and buy their first gun ""while they still can"".
before the '68 gun control act, most of the ""shooting fraternity""
viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate,
ineffective toys. there probably weren't six million of them in
the whole country. now, thanks to kennedy, metzenbaum, the bradys,
and their ilk -- america's greatest sporting goods sales team -- we
probably manufacture at least that many every year.
the fascinating datum is that handgun control, et al. are perfectly
aware of this -- so i guess you'll have to ask them yourself what
their real motives are.
look: gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way,
it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic;
the fact that i can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the
self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing
this further). even if it were difficult, there are already a
quarter billion firearms in america, with an estimated ""half life""
of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel. guns are gonna
be around a long time, adrian, whether you like it or not.
as for me, to paraphrase elmer keith, regardless of what the law
provides or any court decides, i'm always going to be armed. and i
will always work to see that others are, as well. the bad news is
that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands
only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given
both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics
and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.
so what's the point?

54118.eml,talk.politics.guns,"if alcohol were again banned today, it would be much more
difficult to manage a large-scale smuggling operation.
the cops now rank just a narrow notch below the military
in communications, intelligence gathering and firepower.
in a similar vein, the amount of marijuana smuggled into
this country has greatly decreased. this is because its
value-per-pound is very low when compared to cocaine or
heroin. it's simply not worth the risk, it's uneconomical.
now, most reefer is domestic. there is less pressure on
the domestic producer (showy raids notwithstanding) and
thus it is economical. of note though ... domestic reefer
is now very strong, so a small volume goes a long way.
you cannot make alcohol stronger than 200 proof - not a
good dollar pound deal.
firearms tend to fall into this low dollar pound area.
it would not be economic to smuggle them in. all production
would have to be local. there are not all that many people
who have both the skill and motivation to assemble worthwhile
firearms from scratch. high-ranking crime figures could
obtain imported uzis and such, but the average person, and

pay through the nose for it."
54119.eml,talk.politics.guns,"awesley replied:
i repeated what i had been told, under what context i had heard it,
supporting the claim that tanks were indeed used in detroit in 67.
the issue has never been whether tanks were used in detroit in 1967. it
has been whether they fired their main guns. you did not merely claim that
tanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress
sniper fire and that they were ""quite"" effective at this. you continue to
back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is
disputing.
awesley went on:
i
spent a few minutes in a library today -- found their computer was
down and they don't have a card catalog. anyway, it took about 10
minutes to find this in nightmare in detroit, a rebellion and it's
victims by sauter and hines, on page 133, telling of the death of
tonia blanding, age 4.
""when the tank was fired upon by snipers it turned in the direction
the shots came from. ... the fifty-caliber machine gun mounted on the
tank belched fire into the buildings. after a short round into the front
of the buildings, the tank guns spit again, tearing apart huge holes out
of the side of the apartment.""
well, it's not the main gun.
""well, it's not the main gun."" gee, that's only the entire point. are you
now going to admit that you were wrong?
will i see any pictures of tanks firing their main
guns? will i see pictures of buildings damaged by the shells? will i
read
the reports of the tank fire? i'll bet you dollar to doughnuts i won't.
it will take more than second-hand accounts from a few old national guard
sergeants shooting the shit to convince me that tanks shelled american
cities in the sixties.
awesley replied:
well, if you bothered to read them, it wouldn't take long at all to
find reports of tank fire -- although not necessarily of the main
guns.
i will never read of tanks firing their main guns in detroit in the '67
riots. there is simply no way that such an event could have taken place
without it being common knowledge even 26 years later. the american
military firing shells from tanks in american cities on blacks would have
been big news.
awesley goes on:
you can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.
to fire fragmentary grenades? i doubt that as well. to fire concussion
grenades? perhaps. to fire tear gas? certainly. but you would be
perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since
it makes your other claim seem more plausible.
and on:
i don't
expect to convince you; you'll have to open your mind and eyes and
actually
do a little research to be convinced one way or the other. let me know
what you find.
i already know what you found: nothing. if i claimed that the marines used
f-4s to launch rockets at buildings in trenton, new jersey would you
believe me? would you suspend judgment until you had a chance to research
it? or would your bullshit filters kick in?
if tanks had fired their main guns in detroit, people would have been
screaming about it for the past two and half decades. i would know about
it. unless you also claim that the national guard managed to cover it up.
if your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you. i prefer
to live in reality. and here in reality, i find it hard to believe that
those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them."
54120.eml,talk.politics.guns,"define ""armed better"". go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the
colt .45. does one fires faster than the other? nope. aside from which
faster rate of fire is usually not desirable. sure it makes the other
guys duck for cover, but just you trying hitting anything with a thompson
in hose-mode. this is why the military is limiting it's m-16 now to
3-round burst-fire. simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops
like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something
often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).
a revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.
- a revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull
the trigger again.
- a double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,
but will fire merely by pulling the trigger.
- a misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again
to rotate to the next round.
- a revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the
hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an
easy motion, even one handed.
- speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines
on semi-autos. can be faster depending on users.
- a misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell
first, time spent which can be fatal. and a vital second or so is often
lost as you realize ""hey, it's jammed!"" before starting to do anything
about clearing it.
- most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round
and cock the hammer. some police carry their semi-autos with the
chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. i do not consider
this safe however. you must trade-off safety to get the same speed
of employment as a revolver.
- there are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of
operation of many of them requires more training.
some police departments switched to glocks, and then started quietly
switching many officers back to the old revolvers. too many were having
accidents, partly due to the poor training they received. not that glocks
require rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex
as the timer on a vcr.
anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun
the police don't know nothing about firearms. turn off cops and hunter
and pay attention. i do not seek here to say ""semi-autos are junk""
merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. a cop
with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than
equipped for anything short of a riot.
gun control is hitting what you aim at. if you whip out a
wonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don't hit anything.
good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit.
i own a 9mm beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon
to something like the ruger security six revolver. if i haven't hit
what i'm aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriously
wrong somewheres. while i might like having the backup capacity of those
extra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the of shots fired in
criminal encounters is less than 5.
what do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? why the same nice simple
.38 revolvers that the police often use. well actually some police
prefer the much heftier .357 magnum, but anyway.....
obplea: don't flame me, i prefer semi-autos for most things. but they
introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve-wracking
as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal.

54130.eml,talk.politics.guns,"preliminary data regarding similar research into kangaroo overpopulation
in australia do not in any way support the cost-effectiveness of this
approach. it may be cost-effective for deer--if you quietly overlook
the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is negative (i.e. a profit) because the (majority of) hunters pay for licences.
the cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have
to be employed to cull the animals, which is not in fact the case.
you figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive
pellets or spread baits?
there has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently,
because the kangaroo population in the grounds of the governor-
general's residence has now reached plague proportions. despite the
whines of the rampant animal-libbers, the most effective method of
controlling the population is still considered to be controlled
shooting.
some people take satisfaction (imho, legitimate satisfaction) in eating
food that they have harvested themselves. the pleasure derived from
hunting is the same as that you get from eating fruit and vegetables
grown in your own garden (and, in general, game meat is probably much
freer of unpleasant chemicals than what you buy from the butcher or
the supermarket).
by ""cannot now be justified"" i guess you mean that you personally

time the average citizen just does not have. i've spent a few years

(though self-defense isn't the reason i own one). my kid sister would
have an even chance of beating me, gun vs. gun, with only a month of

excellent point. perhaps you aren't so naive after all?
taken into consideration in what respect? though quite wrong, let's
make it a blanket statement for weapons in general. this has been
taken into consideration. we call use of them aggrivated assault,
assault with a deadly weapon, assault with intent to kill, attempted
murder, and a whole host of others, and tack on extra prison time.
in norway i suspect it was about the only weapon available. you conquered
your land (among others) a full millenia before we were thought of, and
shortly thereafter weapons weren't quite so common. i suspect that a few
world wars made a difference too, since in times of emergency weapons
tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes. i'm curious, though,
were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime, or
were they aquired by other means? any requirements other than just
registering the shotgun?

basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good.
in america, the individual is more important than the masses. personal

personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would
have sent our armed forces anywhere. one poor effect of this culture
we have is that we're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy
to identify with only a small segment of the population. my grandmother
tells of being discriminated against back in denmark because she spoke
""low dane,"" whereas others spoke ""high dane."" it was shortly after
world war ii, as i remember, that ""low dane"" was abolished so there was
one common dialect. we cannot fathom such a minor thing being a problem,
because we have even more obvious means of identifying an ""outsider.""

like 'crime-watch' to increase this effect, and the relative
effectiveness of the police. when hostiles are arrested, the
good neighbors step up and say ""that's the one officer ! he

lethal. even blanks which have no projectile can cause death if the
muzzle is in close proximity to the victim. i have heard of rubber or
plastic bullets being used effectively during riot situations where the
intent is crowd control, rather than close range self defense ; i've also
seen reports of deaths caused by them the british in northern ireland .
use of a firearm for self defense is appropriate and lawful only in the
gravest of situations; at that point, i consider deadly lethal force to
be a proper reaction and so does the law .
furthermore, use of less effective but still potentially lethal force
has its own set of problems. it may well take more applications of the
less effective force to stop the incident; this places all parties at some
risk; the victim because the attack has not stopped, and the assailent
since the aggregate damage done by the multiple applications may well be
more deadly.

- how nbc, cbs, and abc have scammed the american people on ""gun control""
- american tv journalism is based on nazi journalism
- why tv journalists lie
- the government with the help of the tv networks, has succeeded in playing

- gun laws are unconstitutional
- american gun laws are based on nazi gun laws
- the government is trying to devide and conquer
- the cia wants your firearms

54147.eml,talk.politics.guns,"however, don't forget that the police in chicago can carry just about

who happened to let off a stray round of 9mm. this is the same anti-gun
police chief that wanted full-auto uzis for his patrol cars...).

get around import number limitations (may have been gunweek where
i read that years ago...)

54154.eml,talk.politics.guns,"i've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even
contributed a few comments) but this stuff ""i'd rather face a knife than
a gun"" has got to come from ignorance! i used to think pretty much the
same thing, then i got 'educated.'
people do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how
quickly you can be killed with one. most people don't understand that
it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick
(within a minute or so) death.
the death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage
points of each other. many people not realizing how deadly knives are
'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives. a gun is deadly
only in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a
remote control weapon. a contact weapon such as a knife controls a
spherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.
most people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by
accident. from 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for
a holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only
moderate skill. from inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a
drawn gun. a knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out
of ammunition. it is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and
ability of it's wielder. criminals in general are young, fast and
strong. it's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks
used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled
slashing attacks of novices. i've talked to several well trained
martial artists. they have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up
against a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as
the attacker.
practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment. practicing
with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a
knife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush. criminals practice their
knife attacks in prison.
if you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize
these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is
the knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced
attacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground. a 60 year old
man with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about
one and a half seconds. dennis tueller with a broken leg in a walking
cast managed it in two. i've seen people close that distance and strike
in 1 second. i'm old, over weight and slow. i can do it in 1.3
seconds. i've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons
that you would not believe. (how about a single stab wound to the chest
with a table fork! in this case the attacker used the handle, not the
pointed end.)
add to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth.
except in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that
destroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve
seconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'
this is true of even heart shots. there is the case of the police woman
in l.a., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart. that
lady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it! all
four of her shots, fired after she had been shot, struck the perp. atta
girl! the bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex
of her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and
destroyed her spleen. it then exited her back leaving a tennis ball
sized hole. she died about six times on the operating table, but was
out of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight
months! she was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest. she was
on her way home so happened to have her gun. no, she doesn't think
civilians should have the same rights. sigh.
the moral of the story is that even if you do manage to shoot a knife
attacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging. a good
alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis. people can often walk
(a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor
them. many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact
weapons. the target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and
is more reliable to stop somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a
caliber powerful enough to 'do the job.' hot .38's on up will usually
do this.
remember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live
and them to fail, whatever the consequences for them. this the reason
'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep
us alive.
i don't want to face a violent attack of any sort. knowing what i now
know, i can't rightly say i'd rather face a knife than an gun. it would
have to depend on the attacker, and if i could pick and choose, i
wouldn't be there. this is really the bottom line. criminals do not
fear the law. criminals do not fear the weapon. they fear the citizen
behind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do
whatever it takes.

militia. but the difinition of modify that applies to how ""well regulated""
modifies ""militia"" is:
to qualify or limit the meaning of. for example, ""wet""
modifes ""day"" in the phrase ""a wet day.""
the amendment is similiar to the statement:
a wet day, being annoying, the right of the people to keep
and wear boots, shall not be infringed.
so how does a dry day pertain the right to use boots? similiar,
what does the ""unorganized militia"" have to due with the right to
own guns?
- the sentence in the second amendment doesn't restrict the right, or
- state or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything other
- than the people. all it does is make a positive statement regarding a
- right of the people. the people, as in you and me, as in the first,
- fourth, ninth, tenth, as well as the second amendment.
- the existence of this right is assumed - it is not granted by the
- amendment. there is no stated or implied condition relating the right
- to bear arms to the necessity of a well-regulated militia to the security of
- in other words, the entire sentence says that the right to keep and
- bear arms is unconditional.
no not, unconditional, but ""shall not be infringed"". infringed
is defined as:
to break or ignore the terms of or obligations (an oath,
an agreement, law, or the like); to disreguard; violate.
to go beyond the boundaries or limits; tresspass; encroach.
this definition implies the following of some form of existing
agreement. laws and agreements are made in advance. boundaries
or limits of behavior are set by society as a whole. the word
""unconditional"" implies no agreements or all previous agreements
are off, which is the opposite.
the words used in the first amendment are much stronger, i.e.,
""congress shall make no law,"" are much stronger. they clearly imply ""unconditional."" if the writers of the amendment, wanted
unconditional whay didn't they says, ""congress shall make no
laws pertaining the the right of the people to keep and bear arms""?
the second amendment implies a sort contract between the people
the people and the state. the bigger part of the contract is
the people have the right to overthrew the government and its laws
at any time. to guarantee this right, the laws cannot stopped
the people from forming a ""well regutaled militia."" the duties
of a ""well regulated militia"" to the government are descussed in
federalist no. 29. and the limits of of the governmental control
of the militia are descussed in article i section 8, article ii
section 2, and the second amendment of the constitution. ----------------------------- ----------------------------------------------- ----------------------------- -----------------------------------------------"
54164.eml,talk.politics.guns,"no, i originally argued that the second amendment was ""a little bit
and an anachronism."" these prohibiting laws are examples why the are
an anachronism. after all, laws in made by representatives of the
people. these representatives of the people have already decided
that the second amendment does not apply or is too broad in some
cases. since these representatives feel an unconditional
interpretation is not wanted, then it is probable that they majority
of the people feel the same way. if this is so, it is an example
of the people using their power of government. if this is not
how the people feel, the people should stand up and state their wishes.
- rkba is dependent on the existence of a top-flight, well-regulated

no, i simple stated that the people have a right to ""join a well

if you are justified in shooting them at all, you are justified in using
the best self defense ammunition you can get your hands on. it might actually
improve the legal outcome.
this is why hollow points hold up in court. they are safer for you, safer
for innocent by standers, (don't as a rule go through the perp) and actually
safer for the perp. if you are using military hard ball, you may have to
shoot him 'many' times, where one or two hollow points might stop him and
do the job. as a rule, the fewer wound channels, the better the chance
for his surviving the incident.

54167.eml,talk.politics.guns,"you're getting warmer. the 'little thing in the trigger' has to be
depressed before the trigger can move. what this means is the damned
thing won't go off until the trigger is pulled. this makes it just
about (there have been some problems, but we're assuming the gun is
functioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver. the gun when working
correctly is totally drop safe.
now, in police work this is a consideration. there is not a single
documented case i'm aware of where a police officer was killed because
he failed to operate the safety on his firearm. there are quite a few
documented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't
figure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus the
proprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likely
prevented the office from getting shot.
the purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire.
this does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down
intentional use! thus the glock safety is perfectly adequate from a
'safety' standpoint, but not necessarily the most desirable from the
standpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else.
by this criteria it does make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece.
from the standpoint of police use, it is no better (or worse) than a
revolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method of
firing it.
the ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that
the firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner, but for now the
wide variety of safety systems helps, unless the criminal happens to be
familiar with that particular type of firearm.

54168.eml,talk.politics.guns,"this isn't rec.guns, so maybe this is getting a bet technical, but i
can't resist....
sometimes..... depends on why it misfired....
i can't imagine doing much combat type shooting single action.....
assuming the cylinder will rotate....
never hurts to err on the side of safety, but if you've got one of those
'new fangled' hammer blocks or transfer bar safeties, it's unnecessarily
redundant. i'd rather have the extra round.
quite true. speed loaders are a little less convenient to pack around
than magazines though.
true, but this is a training function.
cocked and locked for single actions or hammer down on double actions
are the only carry modes that make sense... the 80 series colt's for
example are quite safe to carry this way.
agreed.
now that i've shot off my mouth a bit, let me back some of this up. it
is true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn't cost you much. on
the other hand, i've had all sorts of interesting things happen over the
years. for example, i've had factory ammunition that has had high
primers. a high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds
to minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem.
an auto? jack the slide and continue.
i've had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from
turning, see clearing paragraph above. about the worst that can happen
with a semi auto is a double feed. this can be cleared in seconds.
most revolvers are more 'fragile' then semi auto's. there are all sorts
of close tolerance parts and fitting involved. dropping the gun, or a
blow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action. many
of the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto
take a gun smith for a revolver. in short a revolver may be less likely
to malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you're out of the fight.
the majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall
into that category.
vincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing
view of most of them. a real good starting place is ayoob's ""the semi
auto pistol for police and self defense.""
in general, i'd agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self
defense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination
that is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi
auto effectively as a self defense arm.
most cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms. if the department
isn't going to train them, they aren't going to take the time on their
own. there is no doubt that training is an issue. the amount of
training required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several
times that of a revolver. many cops don't bother.
for myself, i'd hate to be limited to one or the other. i'd rather pick
what fits better with my personal inclination, what i'm wearing that day
and so on. like the moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!
that said, i have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of
buying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a
ruger or smith revolver.... (sorry colt fans. colt revolvers are ok
too!)
if this post had gone the other way, i'd be arguing for revolvers. :-)
rick."
54169.eml,talk.politics.guns,"i suppose that depends on how you define 'vast' majority....
you are correct about 'majority.' somewhere between 1 out of three and
one out of 10 will at some period in their lives experience a violent
assault. the risk is generally higher than emergency medical problems
like heart attack and stroke.
'vast' is probably too loose a term. with approximately 1,000,000 americans
using firearms each year, over a 30 year period we get (roughly, since some
may have to do this more than once) 30 million americans with experience in
using firearms for self defense. 30 250 yields 12 percent of the population.
(yes, i know that is a real rough estimate. we're closer to 270 million now,
but many of these are minors and should be included etc, thus the percentage
if anything is low.)
at any rate, most minority groups in this range are not usually referred
to as 'tiny' minorities, so i don't see how the other part of the group
can be referred to as the 'vast' majority. a little more work might
support a 'simple' majority of americans never use, own or display a firearm.
certainly when you are talking about ownership you are wrong. nearly half
of your fellow citizens own one or more firearms.
please provide a list of other means that are as effective. then you might
convince your local police departments to switch. good luck.

while our country was founded by a bunch of rugged individualists who told the
european monarchies (for the most part) to take a flying leap (used more polite

then convinced the french that it was in their best interests not to complain..

the point of gun control (to prevent criminals from legally purchasing

target shooting and self-defence. like cars, murder isn't
their only (or even a common) use.
i certainly couldn't imagine the american public accepting regulation
of axes. while the politics of other nations may be different,
in america there is strong opposition to any intrusive law that
primarily would effect the average, law-abiding citizen who had
not done anything wrong.
a good way to deal with which problem? it is an excelent way to deal
with the short-term problem of rioting and violent attacks. of course,
it doesn't do anything for the long-term issues that start riots. but
at this point, what can these individuals do about long-term social
problems?
there are, according to surveys, guns in 40 of american homes.
in many parts of the country, this is closer to 100 . those places
where almost everyone owns a gun are, on average, safer than those

abusing gun-control restrictions. i don't think it is paranoid
to worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused
in thye future. after so many times of getting burned any sane person
will stop putting his hand on the stove.
i'd love to. but as long as the politicians grab power to sell
pork back to their constituents, there's not a lot i can do.
it's silly to suggest that if there's anything we can't trust
the government to do, and therefore the government should be allowed
to do it, then we should change governments. down that road lies
total government power. i've never been a fan of totalitarianism.
this is very likely.
the north american continent is not europe, no matter how many
people would like it to be. drugs are very illegal and they're
here. for years canada has crowed about its gun control. if it is
necessary to control guns over the whole continent, then canada should
have always had comparable rates to the u.s., yet they still don't.
unless you can tell me why the canadian border is so much more
magical than the mexican border (which is shorter and far more
heavily patrolled) then i really can't accept that argument.
no, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the u.s.,
two-thirds of which are suicides. (unfortunately i don't have suicide
rates for norway.) however, this makes the per-gun death rate about
half the per-car death rate.
the problem's been humans since before we had stone axes. the
fct of the matter is simply this: if nobody ever assaulted anybody,
whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally
irrelevent.
yet weapons are built . i'd suggest, then, that the murderous
impulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.
anyway, the bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt
to kill each other for half a thousand years. taking away their guns, even
if we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.
in the u.s., approximately 60 of murders are commited with firearms.
(50 with handguns, 10 with non-handguns.) the reason i say that guns, per
se, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of europe's
countries entire violent crime rate. i don't really think we've got
more knives or fists.
in any case, i think examples of gun control applied to the u.s.
have been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms
of prohibition. until you deal with why people are doing what they
are doing, you won't solve your problem. and if the problem is
violent crime, you shouldn't concentrate on the tools instead. the vast majority of guns is never, ever misused. (on the order of
99.5 over the entire lifetime of the gun). this says to me that
you can't make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.
the situation is not ""good"" in that people fear for their lives.
but recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots,
protecting their shops with guns. would it have been better they,
too, lost their livelihoods?
the problem of poverty and rage in los angeles, no it isn't.
however, if that problem becomes a violent action, then yes, it can
be appropriate. whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition
won't make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.
you have to examine which problem you're referring to. if
you're discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is
a perfectly legitimate response to make them stop. (hopefully
simply letting them know you're prepared to shoot them would be enough,
as it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.)
45 of households have some form of firearm, usually a long gun.
that accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million americans.
firearm ownership is most likely among educated, well-off whites, the
group least likely to be involved in violent crime.
you may take that for what it's worth.

54192.eml,talk.politics.guns,"for me, it would be an obvious choice: armed self-defence is clearly
and strongly protected by the colorado constitution and the laws
of the state. in the very clear-cut situation of your hypothetical,
i wouldn't have anything to fear from the police (unless i had been
publicly carrying the weapon concealed, something i'm not in
the habit of doing... even then, the worst i'd have to deal with
was a class 2 misdemeanor.) even if the situation were not so
clear, and i might have to worry about arrest for manslaughter or
homicide, it would still be safer to wait for the police. if
i were to leave and try to avoid police involvement, i'd be committing
several felonies and ruining my chances of claiming self-defence
in court (""if it really was self-defence,"" the prosecuter would
ask, ""why did you run away and hide from the police?"")
in other states, however, this decision might not be so clear-cut:
if someone in, say, washington d.c. were to use a gun in self-defence
he would automatically be guilty of several felony violations of
that city's gun control laws. such a person's choices would be
between certain conviction for a couple of felonies versus possible
conviction for half a dozen.

54194.eml,talk.politics.guns,"i think the point is being missed - that it is apparantly acceptable for
big government (big brother?) to use tanks to control the people, as
long as they don't use the big gun (but everything else is allright...).
tanks deployed against civilians, let alone firing on them with crew
served weaponry (a .50 heavy machine gun is crew-served) is something
both our press and government howl about instantly when done in some
other country. against civilians that have, at most, one-shot-at-a-time
light small arms. certainly nothing that places the people in or behind
the tank in any real danger. molotov coctails? a round from a rifle
or pistol deals with anybody approaching with one of those. and ""snipers""
too often turn out to be strays from other cops guard army gunfire.
i don't know about the other people in this group (or on the net) but
the idea of tanks being used to control civilians, in anything that
pretends to be a free society is outrageous. when big government feels
it is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests (even
violent) of the citizens, that suggests that the government is totally
out of control, since that is effectively the government declaring war
on its own people. if the government was living up to its responsibility,
government of the people by the people, not the 'lords' and other elites
who want to keep their good thing going, the citizens wouldn't feel the
need to be resorting to acts that need to be squashed with a military
boot. people do things like that because they have become convinced
that it is the only option that remains, other attempts to have grievances
redressed have been ignored. and yes, there is a criminal element that
will exploit this, but the fact remains that the government has been
unresponsive or such acts wouldn't be apt to happen. still not an excuse
to open up on civilians with tanks, heavy machine guns, or whatever.
its the old 'might makes right' philosophy that is the hallmark of a
government going rogue: they don't like it? tough. we will simply
squash them under an iron boot. actually addressing their grievances
in other than token fashion with huge volumes of hot air is just too
inconvenient... sort of a variation on mushroom management: keep them
in the dark, smother them with shit, and crush them when ready...
and these are the folks that many liberals are trying to arrange things
so that they will have a monopoly on coercive force (firearms that are
than expensive toys...) by gutting the bill of rights (cuz it just isn't
progressive or doesn't fit in with modern thinking anymore)...
unbelievable.
and i do believe amid the smoke, confusion, etc of a real riot situation,
that it would be possible for a tank to get away with firing the main gun
into a building at close range? one would hear an explosion among many
explosions. it is loud, but it is not going to stand out like a 1000
pound bomb or a tactical nuke. there would be a hole blown in the wall,
and some rubble, but with tanks knocking over walls, and other sources
of buildings turning into rubble, and other covering racket such as
gunfire, including 50's tacking away, it would not stand out that much,
and could be explained by ""musta been a gas leak... "". i think it could be
done and not be reported under such conditions - it is possible. it is
not like a tank driving down a quiet street on a sunday afternoon, turning
and firing, you know. that would stand out, and be pretty impossible

54197.eml,talk.politics.guns,"randy weaver kevin harris trial update: day 4.
friday, april 16, 1993 was the fourth day of the trial.
synopsis: defense attorney gerry spence cross-examined agent
cooper under repeated objections from prosecutor ronald
howen. spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.
the day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of deputy
marshal larry cooper by defense attorney gerry spence. although
spence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy
must involve destroying the credibility of agent cooper. cooper is
the government's only eyewitness to the death of agent degan.
spence attacked cooper's credibility by pointing out discrepancies
between cooper's statements last september and those made in court.
cooper conceded that, ""you have all these things compressed into
a few seconds...it's difficult to remember what went on first.""
cooper acknowledged that he carried a ""9mm colt commando submachine
gun with a silenced barrel."" i thought a colt commando was a revolver! cooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific
plans to use the weapon when they started to kill weaver's dog.
when spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by degan's
m-16 rifle when degan was apparently dead, cooper could not say for
sure that degan did not return fire before going down.
spence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent)
had cooper discussed last august's events, cooper responded, ""if
you're implying that we got our story together, you're wrong,
counselor."" spence continued to advance the defense's version of
the events: namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by
killing the weaver's dog. cooper disagreed.
assistant u.s. attorney ronald howen repeatedly objected to spence's
virulent cross-examination of agent cooper, arguing that the questions
were repetitive and spence was wasting time. howen also complained
that spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the
defense's version of the events. u.s. district judge edward lodge
sustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted
until judge lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to
admonish both attorneys. ""i'm not going to play games with either
counsel. this has been a personality problem from day 1, so start
acting like professionals.""
spence told the judge that, ""when all the evidence is in, we'll see
that ... his agent larry cooper testimony is not credible, that
he was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.""
spence continued, ""we're going to find...that there is a very unlikely
similarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between
the testimony of mr. cooper and the other witnesses.""
spence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that howen's repeated
objections would prevent a fair trial, ""we can't have a fair trial if the
jury believes i'm some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes i'm
bending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that i'm
violating court orders.""
judge lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of howen's
objections had somehow prejudiced the jury was ""preposterous"" and
denied the motion for a mistrial. lodge did tell howen to restrict
his comments when objecting.
the trial resumed with the prosecution calling fbi special agent greg
rampton. the prosecution's purpose was simply to introduce five
weapons found in the cabin as evidence: however, the defense seized
on the opportunity to further address cooper's credibility.
defense attorney ellison matthews (harris' other attorney) questioned
rampton about the dog. rampton stated that there were no specific
plans to kill the weaver's dog without being detected. matthews then
had rampton read a septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which rampton
had said that cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon
was to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them.
rampton then acknowledged that he believed that cooper had said that,
but he could not remember when. he then stated that, ""i did not conduct
the primary interview with deputy cooper, but i have had conversations
with him since the interview was conducted.""
monday, april 19, 1993 will begin the fifth day of the trial. scheduled
is the continued cross-examination of fbi agent greg rampton."
54198.eml,talk.politics.guns,"file follows hi folks;
as perhaps the only boise resident on the list, i guess it
kind of falls on me to keep people updated about the
randy weaver kevin harris trial.
yesterday marked the seating of the jury. apparently no other
legal activities occurred. the jury was selected and things
start today.
more interesting is what happenned outside. about a dozen
weaver supporters showed up to stage a protest outside the
courthouse. one woman carried a sign that read, ""who stands
trial for the murder of vicki and (son's name - i forget)
weaver?"" on the evening news she said, ""i am here protesting
because i believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion.
i thought we all did."" nice sound bite (grin)!
the news reporter also interviewed some guy named ""tim""
who refused to give his last name. not to prejudge the
guy, but he looked like a neo-nazi. he also said he
expected many neo-nazis to show up throughout the trial.
""tim"" had been handing out leaflets in support of weaver
and harris and the news had footage of a boise cop
telling him to move along or he'd arrest. i don't know
the finer points of this one. perhaps there's a law
against political activity within x feet of a courthouse
or something (what happenned to the first amendment?!?).
most ominous of all was that the local reporter filmed
an agent of the gestapo...err...atf with a minicam
filming the protestors! welcome to the world of big brother.
anyhow, gerry spence came out and asked the protestors to
leave because he didn't think it would help weaver's case
any. he said he was confident that, once the evidence
came out, that weaver would be aquitted.
more stuff as it comes available.

54199.eml,talk.politics.guns,"1. are these the current versions of the brady bill?
what is the status of these bills? i've heard they're ""in committee"".
how close is that to being made law?
2. s414 and hr1025 seem fairly similar. are there any important
differences i missed?
3. s414 seems to have some serious loopholes:
a. s414 doesn't specify an ""appeals"" process to wrongful denial during
the waiting period, other than a civil lawsuit(?) (s414 has an appeals
process once the required instant background check system is established,
but not before).
b. the police are explicitly not liable for mistakes in denying approving
using existing records (so who would i sue in ""a"" above to have an
inaccurate record corrected?)
c. s414 includes an exception-to-waiting-period clause for if a person
can convince the local chief law-enforcement officer (cleo) of an
immediate threat to his or her life, or life of a household member.
but s414 doesn't say exactly what is considered a ""threat"", nor does
it place a limit on how long the cleo takes to issue an exception
statement.
true? have i misunderstood? any other 'holes?
4. with just s414, what's to stop a person with a ""clean"" record from
buying guns, grinding off the serial numbers, and selling them to crooks?
at minimum, what additional laws are needed to prevent this?
'seems at min. a ""gun counting"" scheme would be needed
(e.g., ""john doe owns n guns""). so, if s414 passes, i wouldn't be surprised
to see legislation for stricter, harder-to-forge i.d.'s plus national gun
registration, justified by a need to make the brady bill work.
please comment. i'm mainly interested in specific problems with the current
legislation--i don't mean to start a general discussion of the merits
of any all waiting-period bills ever proposed.

armenian government planned and carried out a genocide against its
muslim subjects. 2.5 million turks and kurds were murdered and the
remainder driven out of their homeland. after one thousand years,
turkish and kurdish lands were empty of turks and kurds.
the survivors found a safe heaven in turkiye.
today, x-soviet armenian government rejects the right of turks and
kurds to return to their muslim lands occupied by x-soviet armenia.
today, x-soviet armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its
predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against
humanity.
x-soviet armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the muslims
by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the turks and kurds.

liberty as their fellow turkish subjects, all being exposed alike to the
rapacity of their common rulers. to one brought up, as most americans have

: muslim population exterminated by the armenians:
why?
: who gives a thunder about your pseudo-scholar jokes? i'am arguing about
: the armenian-nazi colaboration during world war ii. any comment?
it could be, perhaps, your head wasn't screwed on just right. in 1941,
while the jews were being assembled for their doom in the nazi concentration
camps, the armenian volunteers in germany formed the first armenian
battalion to fight alongside the nazis. in 1943, this battalion had
grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the
former guerilla leader dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the
short-lived armenian dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the
cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million turks and kurds between 1914-1920.
an armenian national council was formed by the notorious dashnak party
leaders in berlin, which was recognized by the nazis. encouraged by
this, the armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed
and espoused fully the principles of the nazis and declared themselves as the
members of the aryan super race and full participants to hitler's policy of
extermination of the jews.
this armenian-nazi conspiracy against the jews during wwii was an ""encore""
performance staged by the armenians during wwi, when they back-stabbed and
exterminated 2.5 million turks by colluding with the invading russian army.
furthermore, as mccarthy put it, the armenian dictatorship was granted
a respite when the ottomans admitted defeat and signed the mudros
armistice with the allies (october 30, 1918). the allies had decided
to create a greater armenia, including the old russian province
of yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of anatolia
claimed by the armenian fanatics. only the area called cilicia
(around the ottoman province of adana) was to be excluded, as it
had already been claimed by the french. the allies quickly set
about attempting to disarm ottoman soldiers and other turks, who
could be expected to oppose their plans.
on april 19, 1919 the british army occupied kars, gave civilian
and military power over to the armenians, then withdrew. the british
planned for kars to be included in the armenian dictatorship, even
though the russian pre-war census had shown kars province to be over
60 muslim. the turks of kars were effectively disarmed, but the
british could not disarm the kurds of the mountains. the fate of
the turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier
in eastern anatolia. murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction
of turkish homes and entire turkish villages drove the turks of
kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded
by remaining units of the ottoman army. the british had left
the scene to the armenian genocide squads. therefore, few
europeans were present to observe the genocide. one british
soldier, colonel rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the
disarmament of otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring.
rawlinson wired to his superiors,
""in the interest of humanity the armenians should not be left in
independent command of the moslim population, as, their troops
being without discipline and not being under effective control,
atrocities were constantly being committed.""

these two beautiful cities of our country which are alike in the

these cities were deliberately burnt by armenians apart from the
destruction suffered during the two-year russian occupation.
all barracks buildings of erzincan, the cavalry barracks in erzurum,
the government building and army corps headquarters are among those
burnt. in short, both cities are burnt, destroyed and trees cut down.
as to the people of these cities:
all people old enough to use weapons rounded up, taken to the sarikamis
direction for road building and were slaughtered. the remaining people,
were subject to cruelties and murder by armenians following the
withdrawal of russians and were partly annihilated the corpses thrown
into wells, burnt in houses, mutilated by bayonets, their abdomens
ripped open in slaughterhouses, their lungs and livers torn out, girls
and women hung up by their hair, after all kinds of devilish acts.

those of the 'spanish inquisition,' are in poverty more dead than alive,
horrified, some driven insane, about 1500 in erzincan and 30,000 in
erzurum. the people are hungry and in poverty, for whatever they had
has been taken away from them, their lands left uncultivated.

i would not feel threatened by those only accepting or pursuing

bank was what is called the spoils of war. hussein ordered the arab legion
to attack israel, which was a poor move, seeing as how the israelis
promptly kicked his butt. the territory is therefore forefeit. retaining
possession of all of the west bank is not desirable, but it beats
national suicide for the israelis. put another way, one could ask why it
is that so many palestinians seem to think that tel-aviv belongs to them
and the future state of palestine. as long as this state of affairs
continues, it seems that to give the palestinians a place from which they
can launch attacks on jews is a real poor idea. giving up the entire west
bank would be idiotic froma security standpoint. in addition, there is
the small matter of jerusalem, which is considered to be part of the west
bank. the chances of the israelis giving up jerusalem are nil. even
leftists who think yasser is a really cool dude, like yossi sarid, aren't
going to propose giving up jerusalem. if he did, he'd get run out of town

wrote that can be wisdomely responded to :
are you calling names, or giving me a title? if the first, read your
paragraph above, if not i accept the title, in order to let you get into the
um, well, debate again.
master of wisdom writes in so what do you expect me to tell you to tell you, master of wsidom, if you insist on giving me names titles i did not ask for you could at
least spell them correctly. sigh.
when you are intentionally neglecting the most important fact that
the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is illegitimate,
and hence all their actions, their courts, their laws are illegitimate on
the ground of occupied territories.
no, i am not neglecting that, i'm merely asking you whether the existance
of israeli citicens in the wb or in gaza invalidates those individuals right
to live, a (as you so eloquently put it) human right. we can get back to the
question of which law should be used in the territories later. also, you have
not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights.
what do you expect me to tell you, master of wisdom, when i did explain my
point in the post, that you ""responded to"". the point is that since israel
is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights
to the occupied palestineans, which is exactly similar the automatic
deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society.
if a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions, then
tell me why any human living today should have any rights at all?
do you consider yourself that you have posed a worthy question here ?
worthy or not, i was just applying your logic to a related problem.
am i to assume you admit it wouldn't hold?
ok, master of wisdom is throwing up.
you people stay away from the screen while he is doing it !
oh did you too watch that comedy where they pipe water through the telephone?
i'll let you in on a secret... it's not for real.. take my word for it.
the question is not which system would solve the me problem. why ? because
any system can solve it.
the laws of minister sharon says kick palestineans out of here (all palestine).
i asked for which system should be used, that will preserve human rights for
all people involved. i assumed that was obvious, but i won't repeat that
mistake. now that i have straightened that out, i'm eagerly awaiting your
reply.
joseph weitz (administrator responsible for jewish colonization)
said it best when writing in his diary in 1940:
""between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both
peoples together in this country.... we shall not achieve our goal of being an independent people with the arabs in this small country.
the only solution is a palestine, at least western palestine (west of
the jordan river) without arabs.... and there is no other way than
to transfer the arabs from here to the neighbouring countries, to
transfer all of them; not one village, not one tribe, should be
left.... only after this transfer will the country be able to
absorb the millions of our own brethren. there is no other way out.""

just a question: if we are to disregard the rather obvious references to
getting israel out of me one way or the other in both plo covenant and hamas
charter (that's the english translations, if you have other information i'd
be interested to have you translate it) why should we give any credence to
a private paper even older? i'm not going to get into the question if he
wrote the above, but it's fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have
their share of fanatics. guess what..? those are not the people that will
make any lasting peace in the region. ever. it's those who are willing to
make a tabula rasa and start over, and willing to give in order to get
something back.
""we"" and ""our"" either refers to zionists or jews (i donot know which).
well, i can give you an answer, you master of wisdom, i will not suggest the
imperialist israeli system for solving the me problem !
i think that is fair enough .
no, that is not an answer, since i asked for a system that could solve
the problem. you said any could be used, then you provided a contradiction.

the gruesome extent of february's killings of azeris by armenians
in the town of hojali is at last emerging in azerbaijan - about
600 men, women and children dead in the worst outrage of the
four-year war over nagorny karabakh.
the figure is drawn from azeri investigators, hojali officials
and casualty lists published in the baku press. diplomats and aid
workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.
the 25 february attack on hojali by armenian forces was one of
the last moves in their four-year campaign to take full control
of nagorny karabakh, the subject of a new round of negotiations
in rome on monday. the bloodshed was something between a fighting
retreat and a massacre, but investigators say that most of the
dead were civilians. the awful number of people killed was first
suppressed by the fearful former communist government in baku.
later it was blurred by armenian denials and grief-stricken
azerbaijan's wild and contradictory allegations of up to 2,000
dead.
the state prosecuter, aydin rasulov, the cheif investigator of a
15-man team looking into what azerbaijan calls the ""hojali
disaster"", said his figure of 600 people dead was a minimum on
preliminary findings. a similar estimate was given by elman
memmedov, the mayor of hojali. an even higher one was printed in
the baku newspaper ordu in may - 479 dead people named and more
than 200 bodies reported unidentified. this figure of nearly 700
dead is quoted as official by leila yunusova, the new spokeswoman
of the azeri ministry of defence.
francois zen ruffinen, head of delegation of the international
red cross in baku, said the muslim imam of the nearby city of
agdam had reported a figure of 580 bodies received at his mosque
from hojali, most of them civilians. ""we did not count the
bodies. but the figure seems reasonable. it is no fantasy,"" mr
zen ruffinen said. ""we have some idea since we gave the body bags
and products to wash the dead.""
mr rasulov endeavours to give an unemotional estimate of the
number of dead in the massacre. ""don't get worked up. it will
take several months to get a final figure,"" the 43-year-old
lawyer said at his small office.
mr rasulov knows about these things. it took him two years to
reach a firm conclusion that 131 people were killed and 714
wounded when soviet troops and tanks crushed a nationalist
uprising in baku in january 1990.
those nationalists, the popular front, finally came to power
three weeks ago and are applying pressure to find out exactly
what happened when hojali, an azeri town which lies about 70
miles from the border with armenia, fell to the armenians.
officially, 184 people have so far been certified as dead, being
the number of people that could be medically examined by the
republic's forensic department. ""this is just a small percentage
of the dead,"" said rafiq youssifov, the republic's chief forensic
scientist. ""they were the only bodies brought to us. remember the
chaos and the fact that we are muslims and have to wash and bury
our dead within 24 hours.""
of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14
years old. gunshots killed 151 people, shrapnel killed 20 and
axes or blunt instruments killed 10. exposure in the highland
snows killed the last three. thirty-three people showed signs of
deliberate mutilation, including ears, noses, breasts or penises
cut off and eyes gouged out, according to professor youssifov's
report. those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those
believed to have been killed, mr rasulov said.
files from mr rasulov's investigative commission are still
disorganised - lists of 44 azeri militiamen are dead here, six
policemen there, and in handwriting of a mosque attendant, the
names of 111 corpses brought to be washed in just one day. the
most heartbreaking account from 850 witnesses interviewed so far
comes from towfiq manafov, an azeri investigator who took a
helicopter flight over the escape route from hojali on 27
february.
""there were too many bodies of dead and wounded on the ground to
count properly: 470-500 in hojali, 650-700 people by the stream
and the road and 85-100 visible around nakhchivanik village,"" mr
manafov wrote in a statement countersigned by the helicopter
pilot.
""people waved up to us for help. we saw three dead children and
one two-year-old alive by one dead woman. the live one was
pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. we tried to land but
armenians started a barrage against our helicopter and we had to
return.""
there has been no consolidation of the lists and figures in
circulation because of the political upheavals of the last few
months and the fact that nobody knows exactly who was in hojali
at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages
taken over by armenian forces.

heroes who fought on amid the bodies
aref sadikov sat quietly in the shade of a cafe-bar on the
caspian sea esplanade of baku and showed a line of stitches in
his trousers, torn by an armenian bullet as he fled the town of
hojali just over three months ago, writes hugh pope.
""i'm still wearing the same clothes, i don't have any others,""
the 51-year-old carpenter said, beginning his account of the
hojali disaster. ""i was wounded in five places, but i am lucky to
be alive.""
mr sadikov and his wife were short of food, without electricity
for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12
days. they sensed the armenian noose was tightening around the
2,000 to 3,000 people left in the straggling azeri town on the
edge of karabakh.
""at about 11pm a bombardment started such as we had never heard
before, eight or nine kinds of weapons, artillery, heavy
machine-guns, the lot,"" mr sadikov said.
soon neighbours were pouring down the street from the direction
of the attack. some huddled in shelters but others started
fleeing the town, down a hill, through a stream and through the
snow into a forest on the other side.
to escape, the townspeople had to reach the azeri town of agdam
about 15 miles away. they thought they were going to make it,
until at about dawn they reached a bottleneck between the two
armenian villages of nakhchivanik and saderak.
""none of my group was hurt up to then ... then we were spotted by
a car on the road, and the armenian outposts started opening
fire,"" mr sadikov said.
azeri militiamen fighting their way out of hojali rushed forward
to force open a corridor for the civilians, but their efforts
were mostly in vain. mr sadikov said only 10 people from his
group of 80 made it through, including his wife and militiaman
son. seven of his immediate relations died, including his
67-year-old elder brother.
""i only had time to reach down and cover his face with his hat,""
he said, pulling his own big flat turkish cap over his eyes. ""we
have never got any of the bodies back.""
the first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.
one hero of the evacuation, alif hajief, was shot dead as he
struggled to change a magazine while covering the third group's
crossing, mr sadikov said.
another hero, elman memmedov, the mayor of hojali, said he and
several others spent the whole day of 26 february in the bushy
hillside, surrounded by dead bodies as they tried to keep three
armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.
as the survivors staggered the last mile into agdam, there was
little comfort in a town from which most of the population was
soon to flee.
""the night after we reached the town there was a big armenian
rocket attack. some people just kept going,"" mr sadikov said. ""i
had to get to the hospital for treatment. i was in a bad way.
they even found a bullet in my sock.""

anyway, the armenians tore apart the ottoman empire's eastern provinces,
massacred 2.5 million defenseless turkish women, children and elderly
people, burned thousands of turkish and kurdish villages and exterminated
the entire turkish population of the armenian dictatorship between
1914-1920. such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today
in armenia brings a depth and verification to the turkish genocide
that is hard to match. a hundred years ago armenians again thought
they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the
russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. several armenian
terror groups like asala sdpa arf terrorism and revisionism triangle
resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent
turks and their families in the united states and europe. it seems that
they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-soviet armenia
today.

""knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions,
armenians looked to russia and europe for the fulfillment of their aims.
armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the first
world war with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse
to serve their state, the ottoman empire, and to assist instead other
invading russian armies. their hope was their participation in the russian
success would be rewarded with an independent armenian state carved out of
ottoman territories. armenian political leaders, army officers, and common
soldiers began deserting in droves.""
""with the russian invasion of eastern anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of
world war i, the degree of armenian collaboration with the ottoman's enemy
increased drastically. ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks,
armenian revolutionaries armed armenian civil populations, who in turn
massacred the muslim population of the province of van in anticipation of

""i have been closely following for two weeks the withdrawal of russians and
armenians from turkish territories through armenia. although two months
have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of armenian gangs, i
have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the armenians at
almost every step. all the villages from trabzon to erzincan and from
erzincan to erzurum are destroyed. corpses of turks brutally and cruelly
slain are everywhere. according to accounts by those who were able to
save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful
events begun when the russian forces evacuated the places which were then
taken over by armenian gangs. the russians usually treated the people
well, but the people feared the intervention of the armenians. once these
places had been taken over by the armenians, however, the massacres begun.
they clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the
armenian and kurdish land from the turks and thus, solve the nationality
problem. today i had the opportunity to meet austrian and german soldiers
who had escaped from russian prison camps and come from kars and
alexander paul (gumru-leninakan)...russian officers tried to save the
turks and there were clashes between russian officers and armenian gangs.
i am now in erzurum, and what i see is terrible. almost the whole city is
destroyed. the smell of the corpses still fills the air. although there are
speculations that armenian gangs murdered austrian and german prisoners as
well, i could not get the supporting evidence in this regard, but there is
proof of murdering of turkish prisoners of war.""

during world war ii armenians were carried away with the german might and

the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors...
armenians were in league with hitler in the last war, on his premise

an appeal to mankind
during the last three years azerbaijan and its multinational
population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of
the soviet union. all humanitarian, constitutional human rights
guaranteed by the un charter, universal declaration of human
rights, helsinki agreements, human problems international forums,
documents signed by the soviet union - all of them are violated.
the ussr's president, government bodies do not defend azerbaijan
though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to
guarantee life and peace.
the 140,000 strong army of armenian terrorists with moscow's
tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against
azerbaijan. as a result, a part of azerbaijan has been occupied
and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.
some 200,000 azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly
deported from the armenian ssr, their historical homeland.
together with them 64,000 russians and 22,000 kurds have also
been driven out, a part of them now settled in azerbaijan.
some 40,000 turkish-meskhetians, lezghins and representatives
of other caucasian nationalities who escaped from the central
asia where the president and government bodies did not guarantee
them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.
one of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against
azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the
armenian extremists' destruction of the karabakh scientific
experimental base of the institute of genetics and selection
of the academy of sciences of the azerbaijan ssr.
we beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance,
for the honour and dignity of 7 million azerbaijanis are
violated, its territory, culture and history are trampled,
its people are shot. there is persistent negative image of
azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over
the whole world by soviet mass media, armenian lobby in the
ussr and the united states.
one of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and
generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance
while the truth is that all these shootings and recent
events stem from the territorial claims of armenia on
azerbaijan.
it is a well documented fact that before the conflict there
were no frictions between armenians and azerbaijanis on the
issue of karabakh. hundreds and thousands armenians placidly
and calmly lived and worked in azerbaijan land, had their
representatives in all government bodies of the azerbaijan
ssr.
we are for a united, indivisible, sovereign azerbaijan, we
are for a common caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one
of the founding fathers of the azerbaijan democratic
republic - muhammed emin rasulzade.
but all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the
soviet leadership in favour of the armenian expansionists
encouraged by moscow and intended to create a new '1,000
year reich' - the 'great armenia' - by annexing the
neighboring lands.
the world public opinion shed tears to save the whales,
suffers for penguins dying out in the antarctic continent.
but what about the lives of seven million human beings?
if these people are muslims, does it mean that they are
less valuable? can people be discriminated by their
colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other
attributes?
all people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers
for help and understanding. this is not the first appeal
of azerbaijan to the world public opinion. our previous
appeals were unheard. however, we still carry the hope
that the truth beyond the russian and armenian propaganda
will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and
stimulate at least as much help and compassion for
azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.

but perhaps turkiye should intervene in the affairs of the caucasus
in the name of peace and democracy. the armenians are christians, the
azerbaijanis are moslems, and islam is a religion especially unloved
by the democrat-westernizers. besides, at the root of this conflict
lie the territorial claims on azerbaijan, a consequence of which
were the blood and suffering of innocent azeri people, hundreds of
thousands of refugees, and gross violations of human rights.
recently armenians attacked the azeri town of khojaly and massacred
thousands of azeris. the paris-based 'association for democracy and
human rights in azerbaijan' puts the number of khojali victims
at 3,145. some of the dead were scalped and mutilated. this whole
thing has now gone entirely too far.
they already did. the scenario and genocide staged by the armenians
78 years ago in the ottoman empire is being reenacted again - this
time in azerbaijan. there are remarkable similarities between the
plots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs.
report taken from the new york times, tuesday, march 3, 1992
massacre by armenians being reported
agdam,azerbaijan,march 2 (reuters) - fresh evidence emerged today
of a massacre of civilians by armenian militants in nagorno-karabakh,
a predominantly armenian enclave of azerbaijan.
the republic of armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed
1,000 people in the azerbaijani populated town of khojaly last week and
massacred men, women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-covered
mountain passes.
but dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to azerbaijani
reports of a massacre.
scalping reported
azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region
by helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their
heads blown off. they said shooting by armenians has prevented them
from retrieving more bodies.
""women and children have been scalped,"" said assad faradshev, an aide
to nagorno-karabakh's azerbaijani governor. ""when we began to pick up bodies,
they began firing at us.""
the azerbaijani militia chief in agdam, rashid mamedov, said: ""the bodies
are lying there like flocks of sheep. even the fascists did nothing like this.""
truckloads of bodies
near agdam on the outskirts of nagorno-karabakh, a reuters photographer,
frederique lengaigne, said she had seen two trucks filled with azerbaijani
bodies.
""in the first one i counted 35, and it looked as though there were as
many in the second,"" she said. ""some had their head cut off, and many had
been burned. they were all men, and a few had been wearing khaki uniforms.

from your posting (where you did not directly adress my question) i inferred
that you thought so. together with the above statement i then assumed that the
reason was the actions of the state of israel. re: your statement of
occupation: i'd like you to define the term, so i don't have to repeat this
'drag the answer out of hasan' procedure more than neccesary.
secondly, surely israeli have human rights, but they ask their goverment to
protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories, not by further oppressing
palestinean human rights.
i'm sorry, but the above sentence does not make sense. please rephrase it.
because not all states are like israel, as oppressive, as ignorant, or as tyrant.
oh, ok. so how about the human rights of the syrians, iraqis and others?
does the name of hama sound familiar? or how about the kurds in iraq and
turkey?
how about the same in sweden (ok, maybe a bit farfetched..) the russians in
the baltic states or the moslem in the old ussr and yugoslavia?
do the serbs have any human rights remainaing, according to you? so you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights.
(i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph).
no, i'm agreeing that to just kick all the palestinians out of israel proper
would probably lead to disaster for both parties. if that's what you refer
to as the 'israeli solution' then so be it.
oh? have you met with them personally, to read their diaries? fascinating.
what do you do for a living?
above you wrote that you understood what i meant (underlined by ):
any system can be used to solve the conflict , but not any system would
resolve it justly.
an unjust solution would be a non-solution, per definition, no?
you said the following:
for all a it holds that a have property b.
there exists an a such that property b does not hold.
thus, either or both statements must be false.
i was merely pointing out a not so small flaw in your reasoning.
since you claim to be logical i felt it best to point this out
before you started using your statements to prove a point or so.
am i then to assume you are not logical?
any quote can be misused, especially when used to stereotype all
individuals by a statement of an individual. if you use the same
methods that you credit 'zionists' with, then where does that place you?
oh, by the way, i'd advice you not to assume anything about my 'loyalties'.
i will and am condemning acts i find vile and inhuman, but i'll try as
long as i can not to assume those acts are by a whole people.
by zionist above do you mean the state of israel, the government of israel,
the leaders of israel (political and or religious) or the jews in
general? if you feel the need to condemn, condemn those responsible
instead. how would you feel if we started condemning you personally
based on the bombings in egypt?

75407.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"this is part of a continuing series of articles containing official turkish
wartime (ww1) governmental telegrams, in translation, entailing the orders
for the extermination of the armenian people in turkey. generally, these
telegrams were issued by the turkish minister of the interior, talaat pasha,
for example, we have the following set regarding children:
""to the government of aleppo.
november 5, 1915. we are informed that the little ones belonging to
the armenians from sivas, mamuret-ul-aziz, diarbekir and erzeroum hundreds of km distance from aleppo are adopted by certain moslem
families and received as servants when they are left alone through
the death of their parents. we inform you that you are to collect
all such children in your province and send them to the places of
deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to
the people.
minister of the interior,
talaat"" 1 ""to the government of aleppo.
september 21, 1915. there is no need for an orphanage. it is not the
time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging their
lives. send them away to the desert and inform us.
minister of the interior,
talaat"" 2 ""to the general committee for settling and deportees.
november 26, 1915. there were more than four hundred children in the
orphanage. they will be added to the caravans and sent to their
places of exile.
abdullahad nuri. 3 ""to the government of aleppo.
january 15, 1916. we hear that certain orphanages which have been
opened receive also the children of the armenians. whether this is
done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt
of it, the government will regard the feeding of such children or
any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it
purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as
detrimental. i recommend that such children shall not be received
into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish
special orphanages for them.
minister of the interior,
talaat."" 4 ""to the government of aleppo.
collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures
to which their parents have been subjected. send the rest away with
the caravans.
minister of the interior,
talaat"" 5 ""from the ministry of the interior to the government of aleppo.
at a time when there are thousands of moslem refugees and the widows
of shekid fallen soldiers are in need of food and protection, it is
not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by
armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble
in the future. it is necessary that these children should be turned
out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of
deportation. those that have been kept till now are also to be sent
away, in compliance with our previous orders, to sivas.
minister of the interior,
talaat"" 6 in 1926, halide edip (a pioneer turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs
about a conversation with talaat pasha, verifying and ""rationalizing"" this
ultra-national fascist anti-armenian mentality, the following:
""i have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for
its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks
it moral. i am ready to die for what i have done, and i know i
shall die for it."" 7 these telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of
talaat pasha's, assassin, soghomon tehlerian. the turkish government never
questioned these ""death march orders"" until 1986, during a time when the world
was again reminded of the genocide of the armenians.
for reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the
turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were
ever issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a
study by s. orel and s. yuca of the turkish historical society.
if one were to examine the sample ""authentic text"" provided in the turkish
historical society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it
too would be a forgery!. in fact, if any of the tests delineated by the
turkish historical society are performed an any piece of ottoman turkish or
persian arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is
a forgery.
today, the body of talaat pasha lies in a tomb on liberty hill, istanbul,
turkey, just next to the yildiz university campus. the body of this genocide
architect was returned to turkey from germany during ww2 when turkey was in a
heightened state of proto-fascism. recently, this monument has served as a
focal point for anti-armenianism in turkey.
this monument represents the epitome of the turkish government's pathological
denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only
crime was to be born armenian.

microdistrict no. 3
sumgait azerbaijan really, people in town didn't know what was happening on february 27. i came
home from school at 12 o'clock, being excused to leave before the last period
in order to go to baku. when we left, everything in town was fine. life was
the same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and
other things. then we got on the sumgait bus bound for baku for my first
cousin's birthday, my father, my mother, and i. we spent the day in baku, and
on the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring
that i'd have enough time to do my homework for the next day.
when we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped
by a very large crowd. the crowd demanded that the armenians get off the bus.
the driver says that there are no armenians on board; then everyone on the bus
begins to shout that there are no armenians on board. the group comes up to
the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking
passports, just going by the way people look. we get off the bus, but are not
taken for armenians.
we set out in the direction of home. at first we were going to go into an old
building where we knew there'd be a place to hide, but the whole road was
packed with groups of people, all the way from block 41 to the 8th
microdistrict. these groups were emptying people's pockets and checking
passports. people who didn't have passports with them were beaten as well.
then we decided to go home instead. near the 12-story high-rises i saw burning
cars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. ""death to
the armenians"" was written on the cars.
when we came into the courtyard--we live in an l-shaped building--it was still
quiet. we went on upstairs, but didn't turn on any lights. we tried to call
baku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on wednesday, not to come.
then there was a knock at the door. it was our neighbors, who advised us to
come down to stay at their place. we went down to their place, and they led us
to the basement. they live on the first floor and have a basement which you
enter across the balcony. we sat in the basement while an armenian woman was
beaten--she ran away naked. our neighbors' daughter said that that's right,
that's what the armenians deserve, because in stepanakert, allegedly, people
were being killed, 11 girls from agdam had been raped. we didn't stay very
long in the basement. we tried to support one another as best we could,
looking out the small window with the iron grating. papa watched and said
things now and then. he said that there was a fire near building 5, probably a
car on fire. then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that
they be shown the apartments where armenians lived. the neighbors said that
there weren't any armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of
the building. they appeared from the 5 2 side of the building, where, i later
found out, a woman had been murdered. the woman who ran away naked died. yuri
avakian was killed, too.
when the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go
home. we went back up to our place and again didn't turn on the light. we
started to gather up our things in order to leave sumgait for a while. we
tried to call a relative who lived in sumgait, but there was no answer. we
decided she had already left.
we sat at home. the phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with my
father. i called him to the phone. it was jeykhun mamedov, from my father's
work brigade. he said he was disgusted by what was happening in our
town. he asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get
out of the city. to be quite honest, papa didn't want to give him our address,
but my mother got on the phone and told him. some 15 minutes after the
call a crowd ran into our entryway. bursting into the building, they broke
down the door and came into the apartment . . .
they came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the armenians
were. they came into our place. we tried to resist, but there was nothing we
could do. one of them took my parents' passports and began to read them. he
read the surname ""danielian,"" turned the page, read ""armenian,"" and that alone
was enough to doom us. he said that we should be moved quickly out into the
courtyard, where they would have done with us. another, standing next to him,
pushed some of the keys on the piano and said ""your death has tolled."" they
had knives and steel truncheons.
i had a knife in my hand. unfortunately, i didn't use it. i just knew that if
i didn't give up the knife things would be much worse. they struck my parents
and said that i should put the knife on the piano. then, one of them commanded
that we be taken outside. one person was giving orders. when we were taken
outdoors i went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. someone started to
push her so she'd walk faster; i let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind
her. when he tried to push me, i hit him, and at that moment they began
beating my parents; i realized that resistance was completely useless.
we are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their
balconies to see what will happen next. the crowd surrounds us. at first they
strike me, and i'm knocked out; when i come to, they beat me again . . . i
lose consciousness often . . . i don't see or hear my parents, since i was the
first one hit and was out cold. when i come to i try to pick them up; they are
lying next to me. the crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from
their balconies. that's it. i try to pick them up, but can't. my left arm is
broken. i start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an
ambulance. the bodies of my parents are still warm.
we were attacked at around 9 o'clock. i regain consciousness at about 11 and
try to make it up the stairs home . . . when i knock at the neighbors' door,
they push me back and tell me to go away. i go up to the third floor, our
neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; she
sends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. i often look out the
window to see if the ambulance has arrived, but i can't see very far as a
result of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken
away. then i calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken
away, and everything will be ok.
but they were still there. later, at 8 in the morning as i found out, the
ambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. if they received
attention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. later, around 12
o'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with
some ""assistants."" they call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives,
and i am taken to the sumgait emergency hospital. there they stitch the wounds
on my head and rebind my arm. at 3 o'clock i and the other armenians who are
in the hospital are sent by ambulance to baku.
in my ward at the sumgait hospital there were five people, all of them
armenians. the hospital was nearly overflowing with armenians. the only
azerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events,
before the 27th.
then i was in the semashko hospital in baku. i was there 38 days. when i was
released, on the 40th day, i found out that my parents were dead. at first
they told me that they were in moscow being treated, but later i found out
that they were dead. my father's older brother told me.
my father's name was nikolai artemovich danielian. he was born in 1938. my
mother, born in 1937, was seda osipovna danielian. papa worked at pmk-20, the
leader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.
they were also beaten on the head. the coroner's report stated that their
heads were smashed open and bled profusely.
at the confrontation i met jeykhun mamedov, who had called. as it turned out
later, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. he had called
specifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address
and dispatch the group. he knew the phone number, but didn't know the address.
before the events i had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the
phone, when he would ask to speak with my father. i knew him by name. he
denies that i was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father
answered it. he denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he
called from home, which also isn't true. i heard noise and the sounds of
automobiles. as i later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had
never served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. he was about 20
years old. i don't know if he has since confessed or not. i am sure that he
was the one who tipped the crowd off. one-hundred percent sure.
my parents were from karabagh. father was from the village of badar, and was
two years old when his family moved to baku, where his elder brothers were to
go to school. he was a student at the naval school, but never graduated. he
went off to work on the virgin lands one of the gigantic agricultural
projects instituted under khrushchev. when he returned he lived in baku, and
later moved to sumgait, helping with the town's construction. mamma was from
the village of dagdagan, also from karabagh. she worked in sumgait, first in
a bookstore, and later, on a construction site.
my sister is older than i. she lives with her husband here in karabagh. i
always loved my parents. that was why i went on to 9th grade, because it
was their dream that i would continue my studies. i finished 8th grade and
wanted to enter the baku nautical school, and after that, the military
school. but later i changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon-
sider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join
the naval school. i was planning to be in the navy almost my whole life
long--since childhood i had dreamed of being a sailor. my father wanted it
more than anything. he always recollected his youth, telling of the school,
and he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.
now i live in karabagh and never plan to leave here. i will stay at the home
of my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.
while in the hospital in baku i learned the fates of many others who had
suffered as well, like ishkhan trdatov . he managed to hold them off at
their residence in microdistrict 3, building 6 2, apartment 6. for a long
time, lost his father gabriel , and by some miracle managed to survive. i
also learned of uncle sasha, from building 5 2, whose daughter was raped
. . . besides them, valery--i forgot his last name--was in the hospital too,
about a year younger than i, he went to school no. 14. he was riding with
his parents in the car. people were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, and
his parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. we even
came to be friends. before that we had just seen each other around town. but
in the hospital we got to know one another better. i learned of the fates of
others, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . .
today suren harutunian, the first secretary of the communist party of armenia,
was shown on television. to be honest i am glad that armenia agreed to
recognize nagorno karabagh as part of the armenian soviet socialist republic.
i was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the baku announcer who read the decision
of the azerbaijani supreme soviet presidium against karabagh becoming part of
armenia.
after the events in sumgait and those in baku, the best solution is to give
karabagh to armenia, return it to armenia, since the people want to live
peacefully with the azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before they
can do that.
i arrived in karabagh on april 11. i felt very bad. i had constant headaches.
after a while my strength returned. my older sister, suzanna, took me in. i
think that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due.
you can't take away what is their due. my parents and i often spoke of nagorno
karabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. we had
even decided that if karabagh would be made part of armenia, we would move
here for sure. we always said that the armenian people had suffered much, and
that what had been done in 1921--removing nagorno karabagh from armenia--was
wrong. sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. and in order to correct
a mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all nagorno karabagh lies
in the hands of our government.

75412.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"contrary to what the ""protocols of zion crowd"" might suggest,
judaism does not have any such goals.
the question you ask is complicated and deserves an honest answer.
i am going to provide one from my own current perspective, not a historical
one. currently, as a non-observant jew israeli american, my own feeling
is that jews from the diaspora do not have a greater right in palestine or
israel, than the palestinians or israelis (both arab and jew) do.
with regard to jewish israelis, they should have the same rights
in israel as do all other israelis.
who are them? if by them you mean the non-religious jews, i think
you should be aware by now that the majority of the settlers and their
supporters are religious. the other part of the problem is, to my
knowledge, not that the palestinians don't want to be a part of israel,
as much as they would accept (for the most part) being full citizens
of israel, with all the priviliges and responsibilities accorded israeli
citizens. what they object to is the current limbo in which they find
themselves.

75414.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"well, if you just waited for 5 more lines you would have read my statement
""secondly, surely israeli have human rights, but ...""
because they belong to the human race, or do you disagree on that too ?
i donot know about you, but it makes full sense to me.
israelis are being killed because israel is occupying , let israel withdraw
and israeli blood will be saved. it isnot the palestineans who undermined
the right of life of israelis, but it is israel which occupied and exposed
the life of its citizens to the the unconcluded war of 1967 !
more generally, the violence in the occupied terretories is part of the intifada,
and i had previously posted a ""long"" article about this issue, whom i finished
by an open question:
suppose the intifada stops, what is the motive for israel to withdraw ?
donot tell hope for peace and this bullshit. everybody in the world looks
and hopes for peace, so why isnot there any. hope of peace is necessary
but not sufficient motive.
as for the arabian countries, their problems are an arabian concern.
the arabian people can deal with it themselves, if the west doesnot intervene.
as for serbs, i donot think that those fucked up rapists (excuse my language
but it really hurts as much if i was in bosnia itself) arenot humans. those
surely came from outer space or something. no human can allow himself
to see such attrocities than to participate in.
ok.
my definition is the same as yours, but one has to look into the world politics.
in politics, a ""solution"" doesnot imply ""just solution"".
it seems that it was problem in the definition of ""solution"".
i think a solution must be just, because otherwise it would never be lasting.
however, when politicians say a solution, they donot mean a just solution but
just a solution.

75417.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"the theory is that the hollering kills the spirit of the criminal nazi
armenians of the asala sdpa arf terrorism and revisionism triangle.
now, try dealing with the rest of what i wrote.
what is more, the activities of the armenian government seem to have been
efforts aimed at eradicating a race (the turks) or aimed at carrying out a
one-sided feud, instead of being a struggle for liberation. from the outset,
the efforts of the armenian revolutionaries within the ottoman borders took
the form of terrorist and destructive actions aimed at mass murder, cruelty
and genocide, so that no other interpretation of them is possible. armenian
activities started during the reign of abdulhamid ii as individual acts of
terror, and then developed into assassinations and surprise attacks. the element
of brute force in these activities increased steadily, culminating in mass
rebellions and widespread fighting during the first world war. furthermore,
when the ottoman army withdrew from eastern anatolia after the 1915 sarikamis
defeat, armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area.
although the russians occupied eastern anatolia as an enemy, nevertheless they
were constrained by the rules of war. however, when they returned to their
country in 1917 after the revolution, armenian revolutionaries were unchecked
in this area for about a year until the ottoman forces returned to erzurum
in 1918. during this period, armenian revolutionaries executed massacres on
the local people which is recorded in historical documents. 1 for example, let us look at a report dated 21 march 1918 which the commander
of the third army submitted when he entered erzurum and erzincan:
""they were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down
by armenians, even the trees were cut down, and they are like a
building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word.""
as for the people who had been living in erzurum and erzincan:
""those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning
with the excuse of forced labor in road construction, they were taken
in the direction of sarikamis and annihilated. when the russian army
withdrew, a part of the remaining people was destroyed in armenian
massacres and cruelties: they were thrown into wells, they were locked
in houses and burned down, they were killed with bayonets and swords, in places
selected as butchering spots, their bellies were torn open, their lungs
were pulled out, and girls and women were hanged by their hair after
being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. a very small part
of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the
cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering
from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived
in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to.
including women and children, such persons discovered so far do not
exceed one thousand five hundred in erzincan and thirty thousand in
erzurum. all the fields in erzincan and erzurum are untilled, everything
that the people had has been taken away from them, and we found them
in a destitute situation. at the present time, the people are subsisting
on some food they obtained, impelled by starvation, from russian storages
left behind after their occupation of this area."" 2 foreign observers who witnessed the events, including russian officers
who did not desert their lines, submitted detailed reports proving the
genocide to ottoman commanders who received them as prisoners of war.
what is most important is that they stated in their reports 'the
massacres did not happen by chance but were planned.' 3 at the end of the war, the german author dr. weiss, his austrian colleague
dr. stein and his turkish colleague mr. ahmet vefik visited trabzon, kars,
erzurum and batum between april 17th and may 20th 1918 to record the
cruelties. their writings not only show the scope of armenian activities,
but also reveal their goal and true nature. 4 1 (the ottoman state, the ministry of war), ""islam ahalinin ducar olduklari

source: ""mitteilungsblatt, berlin, december 1939, nr. 2 and 5-6""
yet another historical fact: a fact that for years has been deliberately
forgotten, concealed, and wiped from memory - the fact of armenian-nazi
collaboration.
a magazine called mitteilungsblatt der deutsch-armenischen gesselschaft
is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. the
magazine was first published in berlin in 1938 during nazi rule of germany
and continued publication until the end of 1944. even the name of the
magazine, which implies a declaration of armenian-nazi cooperation,
is attention-getting.
this magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically
important as documentary evidence. it is a heap of writing that should be
an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind.
in nazi germany, armenians were considered to be an aryan race and certain
political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. they
occupied positions in public service and were partners in nazi practices.
the whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered
""aryan"" and what befell them.

old friend, whatever....
that is a great attitude for someone who wants to pressure the serbs to
accept a peace plan that gives them most of the territory they got by
force and terror.
this is a good thing to hear. anybody wondering why serbia is not
really under any boycott? anybody remembers the gulf war? did saddam
kill 100,000 people and rape 50,000 women?
still in the threatening stage.. maybe when there is no more bosnians,
the un will lift the arms embargo on them! military intervention? that
is reserved for muslim countries.
now hear this:
real positive i might add, in favor of his old freinds of course!
you bet they are not!
anybody is still convinced that this is not a religious war?
a psychopath like karadzik is considered a peacelover.. of course he
sent 100,000 muslims to permanent peace. with the blessings of patriarch

well, panos, mr. tamamidis?, the way you put it it is only the turks
who bear the responsibility of the things happening today. that is hard to
believe for somebody trying to be objective.
when it comes to conflicts like our countries having you cannot
blame one side only, there always are bad guys on both sides.
what were you doing on anatolia after the ww1 anyway?
do you think it was your right to be there?
i am not saying that conflicts started with that. it is only
not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering.
it is sad that we (both) still are not trying to compromise.
i remember the action of the turkish government by removing the
visa requirement for greeks to come to turkey. i thought it
was a positive attempt to make the relations better.
the greeks i mentioned who wouldn't talk to me are educated
people. they have never met me but they know! i am bad person
because i am from turkey. politics is not my business, and it is
not the business of most of the turks. when it comes to individuals
why the hatred? so that makes me think that there is some kind of
brainwashing going on in greece. after all why would an educated person
treat every person from a nation the same way? can you tell me about your
history books and things you learn about greek-turkish
encounters during your schooling.

resident at building 17 33b, apartment 15
microdistrict no. 3
sumgait azerbaijan on the 27th my sister marina and i went to the movies the seven o'clock show,
at the theater that is across from the city party committee, about 50 yards
away. the sk theater. they were showing an argentinian film, ""the abyss.""
before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at
the city party committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation
whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. that is, we knew it
was about karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if
someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. we bought our tickets. there
were 30 or 40 people in the theater. this was a very small number for that
large movie theater. the film started. about 30 minutes later they stopped the
film. a crowd burst in. about 60 people. they came up onto the stage. well
mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. they demanded that an
armenian woman come up onto the stage. they used foul language and said that
they were going to show what azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do
to armenian girls. i thought that's what they meant because they had demanded
a girl specifically. marina and i were sitting together. i told her to move
over, there were some russian girls sitting nearby. so that if someone
recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not marina.
it got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's
only opened at the end of the show--and they returned to their seats.
everyone in the theater was looking at one another, russians, azerbaijanis,
people of various nationalities. but no one reacted at all, no one in the
auditorium made a sound. they were silent, looking at one another, and
gradually started to leave. some guy, a really fat one, says, ""ok, we've
scared them enough, let's leave."" they leave slowly, pompously. it seemed to
me that those people were not themselves. either they had smoked a bunch of
""anasha"", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like
they were ready to tear anyone apart. then it was all over, as though nothing
had happened at all. the film started up again, it was one of those cheerful
films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. we
could barely sit to the end. so it had started at seven it was over by nine,
and it was dark . . .
marina and i were walking home, lenin street, that's the center of town. lenin
street was packed, just packed with young people. they were shouting,
something about karabagh and something about armenians. we weren't especially
listening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to
make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? public transportation
wasn't running. incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police,
policemen standing there. the director of the movie theater was looking at the
doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors
there are basically all glass. everything was broken. he stood there grief-
stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some
naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. well,
since he looked more or less calm i decided that, nothing all that super
serious had happened. we went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we
live literally one stop away. we didn't want to go on foot, not because it was
dark, but because something might happen. we flagged down a cab, but the
driver didn't want to take us. we told him we live near the bus station, and
he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. i said, well,
ok . . .
so we got into the cab and managed to get there. something incredible was
happening at the bus station. there was a traffic jam. public transportation
was at a standstill and everyone was shouting ""ka-ra-bagh,"" they're not going
to give up karabagh. i go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's
immediate panic in the house. mamma says, what should we do? like the end had
come, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . somehow we managed to
cheer ourselves up: nothing that bad could happen. where are we living anyway,
just what kind of social order do we have? somehow we manage to calm mamma
down. and we went to bed. but no one could sleep. everyone made as though
nothing had happened.
that was on saturday. in short, the day went by. we didn't go anywhere and
didn't call our relatives. no one did anything. because . . . life goes on.
that day i realized something was approaching, but what exactly, i couldn't
guess.
on the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always
had. there were five of us at home: mamma, papa and us, three sisters: lyuda,
marina, and i. my sister lyuda was in yerevan at the time. we sat at home and
no one went out. later we learned that a demonstration had started that
morning. it all started . . . they were smashing up stores. we were sitting at
home and didn't know anything about it. then a girlfriend of mine, lyuda
zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock i think. we worked together, we did
our apprenticeships together, she's a russian girl. she said that something
awful was happening in town. i asked, ""don't they want armenians? well what
are they after, if they're already in that state?"" she says, no, nothing like
that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. somehow, it feels
like a war has broken out. public transportation has been stopped . . . the
cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.
then papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy
problems at the time . . . he left the house and our neighbor, aunt vera,
asked him, ""where are you going? stop! there are such terrible things going
on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?"" papa didn't know what she
was talking about. she simply pushed him back into the entryway. he came home
and told mamma. mamma said, ""well, if aunt vera was talking like that it means
that something is really going on."" but we didn't go see her, she's a russian,
she lives across from us. i had to see my friend out. around five o'clock i
tell lyuda, ""ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, i'll see
you out."" mamma says, ""you don't need to go, it's too late already, you can
see what the situation in town is."" so we decided to stay home. dinner was
ready. mamma says, ""let her eat with us, then she can go."" we sat down at the
table. but no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything
out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating.
we turned on the television, and the show ""in fairy-tale land"" was coming on.
we cleared the table.
we hear some noise out in the courtyard. i go out on the balcony, but i can't
see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus
station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. there is mob of people
. . . i can't figure out what's happening. they're shouting something, looking
somewhere, i can't make out what is going on. i go down to a neighbor, she's
an azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. i go down
to look from their place. i see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story
buildings near the bus station. just then soldiers set upon them, about 20
people, with clubs. the mob runs off in different directions. i even see
several people from our building. they are looking and laughing . . . i decide
that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not
killing anyone. but now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. one of
the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their
feet, everyone's kicking him . . . i become ill and go home, and explain in
general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . . can't speak
. . . well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . .
if each of them kicked him just once . . . they took his club away from him
and started to beat him with it. but it was far away and i couldn't see if he
got up and left or not.
i become terrified and go home and say, ""lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our
place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . "" then the crowd
runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and
starts shouting something. we go out onto the balcony. all of our neighbors
are also out on theirs, too. everyone is standing, staring. the mob is
shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. as it
turns out, at the 12-story building the azerbaijani neighbors went down and
kept them from coming in. there's only one entryway there, they could stop
them.
they all run up to our building. mamma immediately starts closing the windows,
afraid that they might throw stones. they have stones and they break the
windows, all of them. there are very many people. we have a large courtyard,
and it's packed with people. they spill up to the first floor so they don't
crush each other. they crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. it's just a huge
cloud of people. they break and burn the motorcycle of the armenian sergey
sargisian, from our building. we close the windows and immediately hear
tramping in our entryway. they come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous
din and roar. it's incomprehensible. mamma told me later that they were
shouting father's name, ""grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,"" or
something like that. i don't remember that, i was spaced out, kind of. mamma
says, ""into the bedroom, quickly!"" in the bedroom we have two tall beds, part
of our dowry; mamma says, ""hide there, they probably won't come in there,
they'll ask something, say something, and leave."" she says, ""we'll tell them
that we live alone here."" i can't imagine that my parents will stand out in
the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . i go to them and say
that i'll stand together with them, i'll talk with them if they come, maybe i
can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: i speak
azerbaijani more or less, and i can find out what they want. i told marina and
lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister lyuda, i can't remember if i told
her anything or not.
then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell
right into the hall. the crows bursts in and starts to shout: get out of here,
leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your armenia; things like that. i
tell them, ""what has happened, speak calmly. one of you, tell me, calmly, what
has happened."" in azerbaijani, they say, ""get out of the apartment, leave."" i
say, ""ok. go downstairs. we'll gather everything we need and leave the
apartment."" i realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with
them, these are animals. they must be stopped. the ones standing in the
doorway, the young guys, say, ""there are old people and one girl with them.
too bad!"" they take two or three steps back. it seems as though i have
pacified them with our exchange. then someone in the courtyard shouts,
commanding them: ""don't you understand what you are saying? kill them?""
and that was it! that was all it took. they grab papa, carry him into one
room, and mamma and me into another. they put mamma on the bed and start
undressing her, beating her legs. they start tearing my clothes, right there,
in front of mamma. i don't remember where they went, what they did, or how
much time passed. i had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body,
and tore my clothes, all at the same time, i don't even know what i said. the
atrocities started. i was savagely raped in that room. they argued among
themselves who would go first.
later, i remember, i came to. i don't know if i'm dead or alive. someone comes
in, someone tall, i think, clean-shaven, in an eskimo dogskin coat, balding.
he looks around at what's happening. at that instant everything stops. it
seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything
depends on him. he looks and says, ""well, we're done here."" they are beating
mamma on the head. they break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs
. . . she loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. papa . . . was
out cold. they want to throw lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the
window open. apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the
windows can't be opened. they leave her next to the window. she was thinking
about being thrown out the window and passed out. she's not a real strong
person anyway . . . he looks at me and sees that i'm saying something, that
i'm still twitching. well, i start saying the opposite of what i should be,
which is humbling myself and pleading. i start shouting, cursing . . . they
don't get any entreaty out of me. i already know that i'm dead, why would i
humble myself before anyone? and he says that if that's what i think, since my
tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that i still look quite appealing
. . . in short, he commands that i be taken outside.
i no longer saw or remembered what was happening to marina and lyuda, i don't
know if they are alive or not. they take me outside. they are dragging me by
my arms, by my legs. they are hitting me against the wall, the railings,
something metal . . . while they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone
else is pinching me . . .i don't even know. i think, my god, when will death
come? if only it were sooner . . . then . . . they carry me out, throw me near
the entryway . . . and start kicking me. i lose consciousness . . . what
happened after that, how many people there were, i don't remember.
i come to after a while, i don't remember how long. a neighbor is bringing me
clothing. i'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. i remember
that i said the same words over and over again: ""mamma, what happened, mamma,
what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?"" i can't make
sense out of anything. there is a guy standing over me, i sort of know him, he
served in afghanistan, his name is igor, he brought me indoors. when they all
went to the third entryway and killed a person there, igor gathered his
courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though
he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. igor agayev is azerbaijani; he
served in afghanistan. there are three brothers. the older brother also served
there, i think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in armenia. igor
brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying,
""karina, i know you, calm down, i'm not one of them."" how do i know who's who
and what's what? i come to, and they clean me up. i was covered in blood. then
papa . . . i saw papa, i saw mamma. and marina, too . . . igor was there when
they dragged marina and lyuda out from under the bed . . . marina . . . lyuda
said that she was russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the
russians, go. and while they are dragging marina out she decides she's going
to tell them she's azerbaijani. igor immediately grabs marina's and lyuda's
hands, because he knows marina, and knows that she is armenian and is our
sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding
on the door so she will open up. she opens the door and igor pushes them in
there. so they survived.
my sister lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things.
while they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back
up again, lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed
there. then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put
it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the
one whose apartment i had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and
knocked on the door. the neighbor opened and said, ""i'm not going to let you
in the apartment because i'm afraid of them. but i'll give you some stockings
and we'll leave the building."" lyuda says, ""i'll stay at your place because of
what's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs."" it was just for a
moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. lyuda came
back to our place and lay under the bed . . .
i came to. mother was there. i can't remember my supervisor's telephone
number, but something had to be done. somehow i remembered and called, and he
came to get us. he didn't have any idea what was going on. he thought we were
simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed
between life and death. he came and got us and took us to the police precinct.
there they looked us over. i was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly,
it was hard to breathe . . .
my supervisor's name is urshan feyruzovich mamedov. he's the head of our
administration. they took us there. when we were leaving, i saw a great number
of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. the buses were ordinary
passenger buses. there were very many soldiers. we left around eleven, right
after eleven. if these people could stop what was happening they could save a
great many lives . . . because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and
what was going on there . . . i think everyone know not only in sumgait, not
only in yerevan. because there they murdered them all one after the next,
without stopping. after us.
i think 14 people died in microdistrict no. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from
buildings 4, 5, and 6. in our building one person died, and one old woman died
from building 16, that's the building in front of ours. there young
azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building.
incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', marina called our relatives
to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. i called a aunt in
microdistrict no. 5. they have three neighbors who are armenians. i said, ""run
quickly, i can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay
alive. hide at azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away."" at that moment
three people came in, policemen. i think they were azerbaijanis. i was in such
awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up,
there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought i would ever see anything
out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face
was pushed out forward. no one would have thought that i would survive, get my
normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. i started to
scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you
here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? one of
the soldiers said, ""don't scream at us. we're muslims, but we're not from the
sumgait police. they called in from daghestan."" so at that point the
daghestan police were there.
when we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there,
there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . i don't know,
maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously
injured to treat them there in the police precinct. i don't know what they
were there for. there were also doctors from baku there. they examined lyuda
and me and said, ""these women need to go to the maternity home, but we don't
know what to do with the rest.""
so they took us, and i lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. my
boss said, ""don't worry, i'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter
what happens."" we went to the hospital. there we were examined by a department
head from the sumgait maternity home, pashayeva, i think her name was. she
examined us. the ambulance was from baku; i figured out that the sumgait
ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. people
called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.
that doctor looked me over and i could tell from her behavior that something
very good had happened, for she became quite glad. i even thought to myself,
""god, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?"" she looks me over and
says, ""now why are you suffering so? you don't know what your people have been
doing, your people did even worse things."" and i think, great, i have to deal
with her . . . and i felt so bad, i thought, why don't i just die so as not to
have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? here i am in this
condition and being told about something that our people did. i just didn't
have the energy to say, ""how could our people possibly be smart enough to
think of something that yours haven't already done?"" i stayed there. then they
brought in another woman, ira b., she was married, and she was raped in her
own apartment, too. there were three of us, ira, lyuda, and 1. the next
morning they took lyuda and ira away. they didn't do anything to help us. this
was in the old maternity home, in the combined block. they didn't do anything
more than examine me, that was it. i didn't want any shots or tranquilizer,
nothing. what shots could have calmed me down? i didn't even want to look at
them.
i lay in the ward. either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur-
pose, but i was alone. i was alone even though the wards were packed. that
same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face
was disfigured. she asked what had happened to me, and i said, ""better to ask
your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can
better explain what happened."" she fell into a faint. all the doctors threw
themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my
ward.
then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me
clothing, because i was literally naked. the only thing i had on was a dress,
but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up
above my knees, and the woman orderly said, ""i can't believe you put on such a
short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?"" i went back to my
ward thinking, just one more thing from something. people from work came and
brought me something in a sack, apples, i think, three or four pounds, but i
couldn't take them. i had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. i said
that i couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. no one
had to bring me anything. some woman took the sack . . . and, oh yes! . . .
then i heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should
be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that i was an
armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. so they must
have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something
else would happen. that it would be worse. or, perhaps, someone was outside on
the street, i don't know. in any case, i didn't sleep a wink that night.
the next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus,
and off we went. i didn't even know where they were taking me. they took me to
the club where the troops were, the very one i was in that ill-fated evening.
i got off the bus. near the city party committee there were a great many
troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. i saw
a few people i knew there, and that calmed me a little. i had already thought
that i was the only one left. so there were five or six of us left in sumgait
after that night. i still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't
come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine.
i didn't know whether to believe him or not. maybe he was just trying to calm
me down, maybe something happened on the way. then i went to the club and saw
a lot of people i knew. they all knew one another, they were all kissing each
other and asking, ""what happened, what went on?"" two days later they came to
see me from work. they were there all the time. each day they came, showed
interest, and were constantly bringing me money. they did everything they
could. of course i'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues
who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions,
neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what
happened. he constantly took an interest. a sincere interest, from the heart
. . . then, about two days later, the secretary of the party committee came,
not from our party organization, but from the first trust, which ours is part
of, comrade kerimov, a very important figure in our town. he made arrangements
with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if i sat down by
myself i couldn't get up or lie down again. there was something wrong with my
lungs, it was hard to breathe. they examined me there several times, there i
lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be
from all the blows, i don't know. they didn't diagnose anything in particular.
when i was in the maternity home i even asked . . . i made it a point of
insisting that they take me to the trauma section because i felt so awful.
there was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . well they took
me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. there were
emergency medical workers on duty in the club. the mother of one of marina's
friends was there. she was the head doctor at the sumgait children's clinic.
they had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what i
needed at that moment, i thought. i said that i was having great difficulty
breathing, i couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me.
they put tight bandages around my chest and waist. later i overheard some
people saying that i had been cut all over. i think they just saw me being all
bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . but i
wasn't cut.
they took us to the khimik boarding house. we lived there a long time. soon
appeared representatives . . . they were agitating. at first people would not
talk to them, and drove them off. one of the armenian women shouted, ""we
demand that seidov come!"" the response was, ""it's seidov who sent us."" seidov
is the chairman of the azerbaijani council of ministers. the woman said,
""we'll only see seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same
things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you
agitators."" and so on. more of them said, ""have seidov himself come."" this
went on day in, day out. the agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us
out of our wits. then people gradually started departing for yerevan because
they realized it was senseless to stay. everything got on our nerves: the
smell, the small children. there were children at the sk club, children who
had literally just come out of the maternity home. what were they doing in a
club that didn't even have running water all the time? at first we had to pay
to eat there. they even overcharged us, as it turned out. on the second day
someone told us that they would bring us food for free. the children were ill.
everything stank there. well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie
theater with seating for no more than 500. you couldn't sit or lie down, it
was impossible to even move. the stench was awful. even the smallest infants
took ill overnight there. i heard that they were arriving seriously ill in
yerevan, the infants. they have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to
mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. people were fainting
right and left. i just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . only
the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. but the women
were in a constant state of panic. it seemed to everyone that they would come
any minute and kill and stab. it seemed clear that we had been gathered
together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie
theater and there wouldn't be a single armenian left. then people went up to
the attic. i didn't see them, i only heard them, because i was lying down and
couldn't get up. i lay right on the stage, we had some room there. apparently
they caught two people with either oil or gas. i think they wanted to burn the
theater. maybe someone saw them, i didn't. i was in no condition to open my
eyes.
everyone was suspicious of everyone else. they would ask, ""aren't you an
azerbaijani? i think i saw you somewhere, i think you're an azerbaijani."" they
led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their
passports, relatives might be covering for each other. half of the people did
not have any documents. there were people who had run out of their homes in
nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like
they should have, with their ids.
so on the 28th, on sunday, i think, the police did nothing to help us. on
monday everything resumed where it had left off on block 41a. they didn't
spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. they killed,
they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. they murdered
the melkumian family whom i knew, my mother worked with them. their daughter-
in-law went to school with my older sister. they were brutally murdered. only
the two daughters-in-law survived. by a miracle one was able to save herself,
she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the
building until she found refuge. she was pregnant and had two small children.
this all continued on monday in block 41a, on the 29th, when the troops were
already in the city.
they murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire
families. they say they didn't even know for sure if the people were armenians
or not. i heard that the lezgins suffered, too. i'm not sure myself, i didn't
see any lezgins who had been injured. they burned cars so it's very difficult
now to say exactly who died and who didn't. it was very difficult to identify
the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in
gasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course i heard
that many people disappeared without a trace, from the btz plant two people,
including a woman who worked the night shift, aunt razmella, who also lived in
microdistrict 3.
they were stopping buses between baku and sumgait. in the evening people who
had been visiting baku were returning to sumgait, and people from baku were
going home from sumgait, and there were students, too. they were simply
savagely murdered. they were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did
what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that
hoard of brutally minded people. they stopped the buses, dragged the armenians
out and killed them on the spot. i didn't see it myself, but i heard that they
put them all in a pile so as to burn them. later it was hard to discern from
the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the
ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, ira
g., if i'm not mistaken. she was in the hospital a long time after that, and
she still can't figure out who saved her. she was also brutally raped and
beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. the fellow pulled her out of that
whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and
carried her to the city. i still can't imagine how he managed to do that.
i heard that from engels grigorian. he knows her, apparently. well a lot of
people went to that hospital anyway. she was in the hospital and singing a
song in armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, i think he still has
that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song,
the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. they
couldn't find the guy who saved her. he left her in someone's apartment and
called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me,
she couldn't remember anyone's face.
i think that i knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe i had
talked with him once. but i received so many blows everything was just knocked
out of my head. i can't remember to this day who he was. then, it seems, i saw
the secretary of the directorate's party organization, where marina works. she
goes to school and works, she goes to night school at azi, and works by day at
the khimzashchita construction and installation administration. i'm the
secretary of the komsomol organization at our administration and often met
with the secretaries of party and komsomol organizations. we had joint
meetings. i know them all, i've even talked with them, and he, i know, is from
armenia. an azerbaijani, but from armenia. it became obvious that many of
those people were azerbaijanis born in armenia.
they took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the
procuracy, because the ussr procuracy got involved in the case, and i iden-
tified the photographs of people who i could more or less recognize. they
showed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our
case, but i can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were
the ones, they're processing it somehow. they tell me that they know that
someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were
dragging me. there was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch
me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. all these
people, all of them, as much as i've heard about them and seen them, they were
all from kafan.
the secretary of the party organization is named najaf, najaf rzayev. he was
there when everything started. it must have been him because i didn't
recognize anyone else in the crowd whom i knew besides him. all the more since
i told him, ""listen, you do something, because you know me."" he turned away
and went toward the bedroom, where marina was. well you couldn't see marina
anyway. there was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out
anyone. all of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually i became
myself again, at the city party committee . . . there were military people
there. i told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. i told them his
name. on march 8 the secretary of our first trust party organization, the one
we're part of, came to see us, his name is najaf rzayev. i tell mamma, ""if
he's here despite the fact that i gave his name, it means that either his
alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think i'm crazy, not
responsible for my words."" he said, ""what did they do to you, how awful,
myself, i hid an armenian family."" then after some time goes by he comes back
again and says something entirely different: ""i wasn't at home, my family and
i went to baku."" i said, ""marina, what is he saying? he said something totally
different before."" after that i didn't go to see our procurator, our case is
being handled by a procurator from voronezh, fedorov by name. fedorov told me
that rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved.
what are they doing with rzayev?
did he prove his alibi or not? they just think that since i was hit in the
head i can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. it will be an
insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the
same time
i'm afraid to say i'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. because no mat-
ter who i name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one
wasn't there. all the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. who did what
exactly i can't say.
when they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but i didn't see it,
because i had my eyes closed all the time. it seemed to me that i always got
it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it
always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. when they were beating my
face i thought they were trying to put my eyes out. so i had my eyes closed,
they took me outside and started to beat me. a young guy, 22, held my arms, he
works at the btz plant. and right nearby, across the road from us, block 41,
is where all this was going on. right across the road from us. the btz
dormitory is over there, that's where he lives. now he's in custody, they even
have proved, as far as i know, that it was he who killed shurik gambarian, the
clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. one person in our
building was killed, it was that man.
a guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. he saw that
he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come
over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. a while after it was
all over, people started making announcements in town saying that
investigators had been summoned. that guy went and told them everything. now
they've caught him, everything's been proved. now, evidently, they've been
beating him, i don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he
himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. some young guy
came to the plant and said, ""everyone who wants to kill armenians come to the
bus station on saturday at ten."" that was it. he said, the ones who wanted to,
went. this was at the btz plant, during the night shift, probably, late friday
night. it was at night, they were at the sauna together. and he said, what do
you mean, do you understand what you are saying? the others were silent,
probably, in their hearts they were thinking, i'm going to go. but they didn't
say anything to one another. he said that he thought it important to to go,
because he had heard a lot about what had happened in kafan, that they had
killed their azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of
that. that guy was also born in kafan. that is certain. and marina says that
the secretary of the party organization is from armenia, too. from
i've participated in the investigation a couple of times. i'm satisfied with
them thus far. they summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word
i said was recorded. i met some guy there . . . by the way, he was an
armenian. i said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, i don't know.
his last name was grigorian, eduard grigorian. he s from sumgait, from
microdistrict 1. he was sentenced i think, to five years, not his first time.
his mother is russian. i met with him at the kgb in baku, at the azerbaijani
kgb. they took us there and showed me photographs. there were so many
photographs, i think they even photographed those people who were caught at
curfew, and i've got them all confused. i say, the face was about like this,
the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. but he could take that coat off
and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a
haystack. well. this guy, grigorian, i said, he was in our apartment, but he
is so light-complected that he looks like a lezgin. i don't know what he did,
i can't remember. maybe he beat me or raped me. but he was in our apartment.
at the kgb he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this,
all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. i took a look
at him and thought, ""my god, heaven forbid that i should have a brother like
you."" but they were satisfied with my responses, because i said everything
without great certainty. i was there with mamma. then lyuda came in, but when
she came in she got sick immediately. she wanted to kill him, she crawled over
the table at him. she recognized him. when she came to, lyuda was lying on the
balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. we had
all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters.
they stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. at that
moment lyuda came to and started remembering everything. well, seeing the
faces, hearing the voices . . . two people were saying they could burn the
apartment. another says, why burn the apartment when i've got three kids and
no place to live. so this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have
anywhere to live, he was from sumgait. they were sure that they would get the
apartment. besides, the neighbors were azerbaijani. why should they burn the
apartment, they might burn azerbaijanis. that's what they said. how did they
know there were azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that
armenians lived there? we have a list of the residents for our part of the
building, our name is in there, but how could they know that azerbaijanis
lived on the other side of the wall from us? so they didn't set fire to our
apartment.
i don't know, i was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt
when i was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, i would
have said that a civil war was going on. well, maybe not civil . . . but
probably civil, because when they were beating me i opened my eyes and saw
that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at
a free horror film. so a civil war was going on, and only the armenians were
being fought. if it were a world war or something like that, they would have
been fighting everyone. but they only fought us. then i met some women from
our building, some azerbaijanis. they are crying, they tell me, ""karina, we
saw all of it, how could it happen?"" they're asking me! well i just don't know
what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to
me. i think that if it were the other way around either i wouldn't have been
able to take it, or i would have tried to avert it, like that one azerbaijani
woman did in front of our building. a woman lives there, an awful, dissipated
woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. two
armenian families live there, in her part of the building. she came out on the
balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. she
came down to the entryway and said, ""you'll come in this entryway over my dead
body."" so not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. some
folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't
even know what they were doing. i don't think that's true. they knew very well
what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. they
couldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an azerbaijani
stopped them.
they were just beasts, they had smoked so much. when they came to our place
they were all chewing something. i noticed: everyone who came into the
apartment was chewing something. i think, my god, maybe i just think that?
maybe i'm losing my mind? but no, they're all chewing something. maybe it is
some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . at first glance they all seemed
to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had
come to some sort of celebration. but they were shouting something. they
didn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. they
screamed and screamed: ""yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the armenians!""
only they didn't shout ""kill,"" they shouted ""gurun ermianlary."" gurun
literally means ""kill,"" or ""destroy.""
that's how it was! i'll continue. we hid in a captain's apartment, he's an
azerbaijani, his wife is a tatar. we were sitting in their apartment, their
kids were out in the yard. their kids knew a whole lot. this was in our part
of the building, on the third floor. when mamma came to and couldn't find
lyuda she took papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things,
but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. apparently
they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. mamma found the
courage to . . .
a boy said to my mother ""where's the gold?"" mamma said he must have been 12
to 14 years old. he even looked russian, he was so fair-skinned. but the
azerbaijanis from armenia are fair-skinned. i noticed they were all on the
fair side. he shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks mamma where
the gold is. we kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. in a
little black bag, we kept everything in there. mamma doesn't really like to
wear gold. she probably never even wore those things from the time they were
bought for her. they took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. mamma
thinks that the gold saved us. because they threw themselves at the gold, and
mamma grabbed papa, who was trying to breathe. they had closed his mouth,
bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . they had
shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. mamma grabbed him and
tore all that stuff off . . . he had something in his mouth, he was having
trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. mamma grabbed him and
started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted
to open their doors to them. mamma said that by accident, completely by
accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake,
""what's happened?"" he sees that they are bloody. mamma said, ""at least go and
find out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or
murdered them, at least bring the corpses."" he went looking for us. at that
moment lyuda was under the bed. she says that after they left it seemed that
someone was calling her name. when he quietly called her she couldn't get out
from under the bed. she wanted to get out and was calling softly. she thought
she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to
herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. when she got out from
under the bed everyone was gone. and again . . . she thought that she had lost
her mind. i'll never leave here, never! to hell with it! it just seems that
way to me, i'll come to eventually. but then, when everything had settled
down, stopped, that mall brought lyuda down, and igor carried me in from
outside. or first i was brought in, then lyuda, i don't remember what order it
happened in.
and mamma said, ""listen, they're all running around down there, shouting
something or other, and running toward the other building."" it had more or
less calmed down where we were. who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. i
tried to call my girlfriend. i had basically come to. mamma says, ""listen;
let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. we don't know how
long we'll be here. maybe they didn't burn everything."" i don't get it, all
women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe
not everything was taken? i tell mamma, ""mamma, what do you need any of that
for? to hell with it! we're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!"" she
says, ""no, let's go get at least something. maybe we'll leave here, spend the
night at someone else's."" mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son
alik, was standing on the lookout. lie was standing there to see if they were
coming. they only managed to run up there and grab something one time. he
shouts, ""come back, they're coming!"" they didn't have enough time to get a
lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . mamma got my
knitting . . . someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore,
out of the hall . . . someone took father's old coveralls. the neighbor, his
wife, mamma and papa . . . marina went with them. i was in no condition to
leave. neither was lyuda. we just sat. they ran out and we closed the door and
just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs,
they're dragging something again. they were going toward the other building,
maybe over by the school, or . . . there was an unfinished building over
there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished
building, they could gradually carry everything over there. then things more
or less calmed down. i tried to call my boss.
later there was more noise. we were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom
apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor,
asya dallakian. she's an old woman, retired. she wasn't at home, at that
time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and
her grandson is in the army. she is only very rarely in town; she gets her
retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. they started
pounding on her door and broke it down. she had two or three beds in there,
something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even
live there. probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and
mattresses, and a television. when her grandson came she bought a television.
they started wrecking everything. i started getting sick again. i think, ""my
god, what is going on around here? when will this end?"" we turned off the
lights and sat. as it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who
knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. we didn't know, but
they didn't come to where we were all the same. they all knew very well that
he was a captain. he went out and closed the door, and we sat in his
apartment. his last name was kasumov. he's an exserviceman, retired, works up
at the fire station at some plant or other. he went out and stood at his door.
they tell him, ""comrade captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of
us."" he went upstairs, and they say, ""aren't you taking anything from this
apartment?"" he says, ""i don't need anything."" and the women who were standing
in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were
standing in the yard saw. those guys, they left everything they stole on the
first floor and ran upstairs again. the women threw everything they had time
to into the basement, to save our property. some things were left: dirty
pillows, two or three other things and a rug. a guy came downstairs, really
mad, and he says, ""where's the rug? i just put it right here!"" they tell him,
""some guy came and took it and went off toward the school."" he ran off in that
direction.
oh! i forgot the most important point. when igor picked me up in his arms,
there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. they
just didn't tell me about it for a long time. the wife of that military man,
she didn't want to kill my spirit, i was already dead enough. later she told
me, that after they murdered uncle shurik in the third entryway one of them,
the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, ""where's the girl who was here?""
and he became furious. the woman tells him, ""she came to . . . "" she didn't
know what to say: think something up? someone carried her off? then they would
comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. so the woman says, ""she
came to and went to the basement."" now, our basement is full of water. so the
whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. they took
flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been
standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. they climbed down in there
to get me. then one of them said, ""there's so much water down there, she
probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. she met her death in
the basement. that's it, we can leave, no problem!"" i didn't know that, and
when i was told, i felt worse. two times worse. a lot worse! so they didn't
just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .
after that we of course didn't want to live in sumgait any longer. we really
didn't want to go back to our apartment. when we moved, i went up there and
started to quiver and shake all over, because i started remembering it all.
although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . the people
who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. i think
that they could have helped! i don't think that they were obligated to, but
they could have helped us! because that one woman was able to stop that whole
brutal crowd by herself. that means they could have, too. it would have been
enough foe one man or women to say, what do you think you're doing?"" that's
all! that would have done it. there were 60 apartments in our building. not
one person said it! when i was lying on the ground and all those people were
standing on their balconies i didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are
you doing, leave her alone . . . mamma even told one of the neighbor women
that if it had been an azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a
bomb if it would have killed even one armenian. they would have stood up for
one of their own. true, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway,
an old sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. the azerbaijanis have a custom:
if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed
to stop immediately. the old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they
stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, ""if
you want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment."" so she left.
that trick didn't work on them.
even the neighbors who helped us move told me, ok, fine, calm down, forget
that it happened. i said i'd only forget it if i told them right then that it
had happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them,
then i would forget everything, too. imagine that it happened to your sister.
and no one did anything. anything.

75884.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"rtw 04 14 2155 jewish group sued for passing official information
by adrian croft
san francisco, april 14, reuter - nineteen people, including the son of
former israeli defence minister moshe arens, sued the anti-defamation league
(adl) on wednesday, accusing the jewish group of disclosing confidential
official information about them.
richard hirschhaut, director of the san francisco branch of the adl, art
dealer roy bullock and former policeman tom gerard were also named as defendants
in the suit, filed in san francisco county superior court.
the 19 accuse the adl of b'nai b'rith, a group dedicated to fighting
anti-semitism, and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on
them, including data from state and federal agencies.
the suit alleges they disclosed the information to others, including the
governments of israel and south africa, in what it alleges was a ""a massive
spying operation.""
the action is a class-action suit. it was filed on behalf of about 12,000
anti-apartheid activists or opponents of israeli policies about whom the
plaintiffs believe the adl, bullock and gerard gathered information.
representatives of the adl in san francisco were not immediately available
for comment on wednesday.
the civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that
gerard, a former inspector in the san francisco police intelligence unit, passed
confidential police files on california political activists to a spy ring.
the fbi and san francisco police are investigating the adl, bullock and
gerard over the affair and last week searched the adl's offices in san francisco
and los angeles.
the suit alleges invasion of privacy under the civil code of california,
which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official sources.
it seeks exemplary damages of at least 2,500 per person as well as other
unspecified damages.
lawyer pete mccloskey, a former congresmen who is representing the
plaintiffs, said the 19 plaintiffs included arab-americans and jews -- and his
wife helen, who also had information gathered about her.
one of the plaintiffs is yigal arens, a research scientist at the
university of southern california who is a son of the former israeli defence
minister.
arens told the san francisco examiner he had seen a file the adl kept on
him in the 1980s, presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of
palestinians and his position on the israeli-occupied territories.
according to court documents released last week, bullock and gerard both
kept information on thousands of california political activists.
in the documents, a police investigator said he believed the adl paid
bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and
bullock received confidential information from the authorities.
no criminal charges have yet been filed in the case. the adl, bullock and
gerard have all denied any wrongdoing.

associated press writer
san francisco (ap) -- arab-americans and critics of israel sued the
anti-defamation league on wednesday, saying it invaded their privacy by
illegally gathering information about them through a nationwide spy network.
the adl, a national group dedicated to fighting anti-semitism, intended to
use the data to discredit them because of their political views, according to
the class-action lawsuit filed in san francisco superior court.
""none of us has been guilty of racism or nazism or anti-semitism or hate
crimes, or any of the other isms' that the adl claims to protect against. none
of us is violent or criminal in any way,"" said carol el-shaieb, an education
consultant who develops programs on arab culture.
the 19 plaintiffs include yigal arens, son of former israel defense minister
moshe arens. the younger arens, a research scientist at the university of
southern california, said the adl kept a file on him in the 1980s presumably
because he has criticized israel's treatment of palestinians.
""the adl believes that anyone who is an arab american ... or speaks
politically against israel is at least a closet anti-semite,"" arens said.
the adl has denied any wrongdoing, but couldn't comment on the lawsuit
because it hasn't reviewed it, said a spokesman at the adl's new york
headquarters.
the fbi and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that
the adl spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups, including
white supremacist and anti-semitic organizations, arab-americans, greenpeace,
the national association for the advancement of colored people and san francisco
public television station kqed.
some information allegedly came from confidential police and government
records, according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit.
no charges have been filed in the criminal investigation.
the lawsuit accuses the adl of violating california's privacy law, which
forbids the intentional disclosure of personal information ""not otherwise
public"" from state or federal records.
the lawsuit claims the adl disclosed the information to ""persons and
entities"" who had no compelling need to receive it. it didn't elaborate.
defendants include richard hirschhaut, director of the adl's office in san
francisco. he did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.
other defendants are san francisco art dealer roy bullock, an alleged adl
informant over the past four decades, and former police officer tom gerard.
gerard allegedly tapped into law enforcement and government computers and passed
information on to bullock.
gerard, who has retired from the police force, has moved to the philippines.
bullock's lawyer, richard breakstone, said he could not comment on the lawsuit
because he had not yet studied it.
upwe 04 14 1956 adl sued for allegedly spying on u.s. residents
san francisco (upi) -- a group of california residents filed suit wednesday
charging the anti-defamation league of b'nai brith with violating their privacy
by spying on them for the israeli and south african governments.
the class-action suit, filed in san francisco superior court, charges the adl
and its leadership conspired with a local police official to obtain information
on outspoken opponents of israeli policies towards the occupied territories and
south africa's apartheid policy.
the adl refused to comment on the suit.
the suit also took aim at two top local adl officials and retired san
francicso police officer tom gerard, claiming they violated privacy guarantees
in the state constitution and violated state confidentiality laws.
according to the suit, gerard helped the adl obtain access to confidential
files in law enforcement and government computers. information from these files
were passed to the foreign governments, the suit charges.
""the whole concept of an organized collection of information based on
political viewpoints and using government agencies as a source of information is
absolutely repugnant,"" said former rep. pete mccloskey, who is representing the
plaintiffs.
the adl's information-gathering network was revealed publicly last week when
the san francisco district attorney's office released documents indicating the
group had spied on 12,000 people and 500 political and ethnic groups for more
than 30 years.
""my understanding is that they (the adl) consider all activity that is in
some sense opposed to israel or israeli action to be part of their responsbility
to investigate,"" said arens, a research scientist at the university of southern
california.
""the adl believes that anyone who is arab american...or speaks politically
against israel is at least a closet anti-semite.""
the fbi and the district attorney's office have been investigating the
operation for four months.
the 19 plaintiffs in the case include arens, the son of former israeli
defense minister moshe arens.
in a press release, the plaintiffs said the alleged spying had damaged them
psychologically and economically and accused the adl of trying to interfere with
their freedom of speech."

diverted water from lebanon--his imagination.
alan h. stein"
75886.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"just trying to get this clear, so please bear with me. as far as
i can tell, you're proposing the following rules of engagement
between israel and the palestinean resistance. please feel
revise this preliminary draft as necessary:
1) israeli military personnel are fair game at any time, in uniform
or out, on duty or off. in practice, since any male or female
israeli of military age (18-?) may be off-duty military, all but
young children are acceptable targets. since the existence of
israel constitutes indication of hostile intent, no further
provocation is required.
2) to avoid inpermissable violations of the rights of non-combatant
palestineans, israeli forces must not engage palestineans
without positive identification as military personnel, clear
indication of aggressive intent, and a clear field of fire.
a) positive identification may be assured by either checking for
palestinean military uniform, by posession of exclusively
military armament (ie, t78 mbts or mig-29 aircraft), or
self-identification (either verbal or documentary). note
that dual-use military civilian weaponry such as hand grenades,
ak-47 rifles, and rpg launchers do not constitute positive
military identification and require closer inspection such
as document checks.
b) aggressive intent (as distinct from merely 'hostile' intent,
which is the normal condition) may be assured by not less
than three rounds of incoming fire separated by intervals
of not less than ten seconds between rounds. note that a
single burst of automatic-weapon fire counds as one round,
as does a volley of rocket fire from more than one source.
as noted above, dual-use weaponry may not be assumed to
originate from military personnel, and thus do not justify
armed response.
c) a clear field of fire can be guaranteed by making a positive
military identification of all personnel in the target area of
the weapons to be used. note that aggressive intent need not
be proven for all possible targets. thus, if iaf aircraft
are attacked by a sam crew it is not necessary to check the
papers of each crew member so long as none are obviously
civilians (as indicated, for instance, by the posession of
uniquely civilian weaponry such as stones, axes, and molotov
coctails.) since it is often difficult for iaf elements to
land and make the necessary checks, ground forces should
first screen prospective strike areas before agm fire.
for acm purposes, a cockpit-to-cockpit pass within 5 meters
is usually sufficient for this purpose, but may be repeated
if necessary."
75887.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"how do you define war? do seiges and constant attacks on villiages
count as acts of war, or is that only when the jews do them?
january, 1948: arab liberation army attacks kfar szold
1000 men attack kfar etzion, 14 miles south of jerusalem,
after cutting off the supply lines to it.
attacks on yehiam (western galilee) and kibbutz tirat tzvi.
by mid-march, the jewish settlements in the negev had been cut off from
land links with the rest of the jewish population.
the etzion group of villiages, near hebron, had been cut off,
while 42 members of a convoy trying to supply yehiam were
slaughtered, cutting off the villiage.
jerusalem was under seige, being cut off from its supply route from
tel aviv (the bombed out supply trucks have been left on the side
of that road to this day in memoriam). by this time, 1200 jews
had been killed.
of course, this isn't war, since it's only the arabs attacking.
just like last week when the fatah launched katyusha rockets
against northern israel. where does uprising end and war begin?

inquisition-esque. essentially, to prove his loyalty to ""the cause"" of

else, or else face death in one of the many fun-filled ways that the death-
squads love so much--beatings, dismemberment, acid, pouring melted plastic
on the face of the 'guilty party,' and of course beheading, always my
favorite. did you catch the photos in the washington post a while back

1) one palestinian leading another at gunpoint.
2) the ""collaborator"" on his knees, the gun pointed at his temple.

camps filled with terrorists. you claim that israelis shell the villages with the
'hope' of finding a terrorist or so. if they kill one, fine, if not, too bad,
civilians die, right ? i am not so sure.
as somebody wrote, saddam hussein had no problems using civilians in disgusting
manner. and he also claimed 'civilians murdered'. let me ask you, isn't there
at least a slight chance that you (not only, and the question is very general,
no insult) are doing a similar type of propaganda in respect to civilians in
southern lebanon ?
now, a lot people who post here consider 'israeli soil' kind of mediteranean sea.
how do you define israeli soil ? from what you say, if you do not clearly
recognize the state of israel, you condone killing israelis anywhere.
i do not know what was the pupose of the action you describe. if it was
to kill civilians (i doubt), i certainly do not condone it. if civilians were
killed, i do not condone it.
mr. hernlem, it was you, not me, who was showing a huge satisfaction for 3
israelis (human beings by most standards, don't know about your standards) killed.
if you ask me those questions, i will have no problem answering (not with a
question, as you did) : no, nobody is qualified candidate for murder, nothing
justifies murder. i have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make
similar statements, maybe after eliminating all israelis, jews, ? am i wrong ?
now tell me, did you also condone saddam's scuds on israeli 'soldiers' in, let's
say, tel aviv ? from what i understand, a lot of palestineans cheered. what does
it show? it does not qualify for freedom fighting to me ? but again, i may be
wrong, and the jewish controlled media distorted the information, and i am just
an ignorant victim of the media, like most of us.

75909.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"one is curious to know the real reasons behind this and related
public relations campaign about iran in recent months. these include:
1) attempts to implicate iran in the bombing of the new york trade
center. despite great efforts in this direction they have not
succeeded in this. they, however, have indirectly created
the impression that iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist
islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter.
2) public statements by the secretary of state christoffer and
other official sources regarding iran being a terrorist and
outlaw state.
3) and finally the recent broadcast of the frontline program. i
suspect that this pr campaign against iran will continue and
perhaps intensify.
why this increased pressure on iran? a number of factors may have
been behind this. these include:
1) the rise of islamic movements in north-africa and radical
hamas movement in the israeli occupied territories. this
movement is basically anti-western and is not necessarily
fueled by iran. the cause for accelerated pace of this
movement is probably the gulf war which sought to return
colonial shieks and amirs to their throne in the name of
democracy and freedom. also, the obvious support of algerian
military coup against the democratically elected algerian
islamic front which clearly exposed the democracy myth.
a further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news
on the slaughter of bosnian moslems.
2) possible future implications of this movement in saudi arabia
and other us client states and endangerment of the cheap oil
sources from this region.
3) a need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense
expenditures. this has become necessary after the demise of
soveit union.
the recent pr campaign against iran, however, seems to be directed
from israel rather than washington. there is no fundamental conflict
of interest between iran and the us and in my opinion, it is in the
interest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal
and friendly relations. this may have a moderating effect on the
rise of radical movements within the islamic world and iran ."

four killed and nearly forty wounded. the number of casualties was
nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. the arab
troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. the fighting
was thus very severe. yet the hostile propaganda, disseminated
throughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian
population of dir yassin was actually given a warning by us before the
battle began. one of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed
at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in arabic all women,
children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the
slopes of the hill. by giving this humane warning our fighters threw
away the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their own
risk in the ensuing battle. a substantial number of the inhabitants
obeyed the warning and they were unhurt. a few did not leave their
stone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. the fire of the enemy
was murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent
testimony. our men were compelled to fight for every house; to
overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. and the
civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable
casualties.
""the education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of
revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. we
never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in
accordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. i am
convinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single
unnecessary casualty in the dir yassin battle. but those who throw
stones of denunciation at the conquerors of dir yassin 1 would do
well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy 2 .
""in connection with the capture of dir yassin the jewish agency
found it necessary to send a letter of apology to abdullah, whom mr.
ben gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wise
ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' the 'wise
ruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished gush etzion and flung the
bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal
superciliousness. he rejected the apology and replied that the jews
were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of
'dissidents.' throughout the arab world and the world at large a wave
of lying propaganda was let loose about 'jewish attrocities.'
""the enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. in the
result it helped us. panic overwhelmed the arabs of eretz israel.
kolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the
haganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting.
beit-iksa was also evacuated. these two places overlooked the main
road; and their fall, together with the capture of kastel by the
haganah, made it possible to keep open the road to jerusalem. in the
rest of the country, too, the arabs began to flee in terror, even
before they clashed with jewish forces. not what happened at dir
yassin, but what was invented about dir yassin, helped to carve the
way to our decisive victories on the battlefield. the legend of dir
yassin helped us in particular in the saving of tiberias and the
conquest of haifa."" 1 (a footnote from the revolt , pp.226-7.) ""to counteract the loss
of dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, arab headquarters at
ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by
irgun troops of women and children in the village. certain jewish
officials, fearing the irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this
arab gruel propaganda to smear the irgun. an eminent rabbi was induced
to reprimand the irgun before he had time to sift the truth. out of
evil, however, good came. this arab propaganda spread a legend of
terror amongst arabs and arab troops, who were seized with panic at
the mention of irgun soldiers. the legend was worth half a dozen
battalions to the forces of israel. the dir yassin massacre' lie
is still propagated by jew-haters all over the world."" 2 in reference to denunciation of dir yassin by fellow jews."

as in the past in turkiye, and today in azerbaijan, for utopic and
idiotic causes the armenians brought havoc to their neighbors. a
short-sighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda
and anachronistic methods the armenians continue to become pernicious
for the region. as usual, they will be treated accordingly by their
neighbors. nagorno-karabag is a mountainous enclave that lies completely
within azerbaijan with no border or history whatsoever connected to
x-soviet armenia. besides the geographical aspect, nagorno-karabag is
the historic homeland and the 'cradle' of the artistic and literary
heritage of azerbaijan, which renders the armenian claims preposterous,
even lunatic.
and we still demand:
1. that the x-soviet armenian government, as the heirs of the armenian
dictatorship, recognize the turkish genocide;
2. that x-soviet armenia return the historic homeland to the turkish and
kurdish people;
3. that the x-soviet armenian government make material reparations for their
heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the turkish genocide;
4. that all world governments officially recognize the turkish genocide
and turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all armenian
political pressure.
the awareness of the turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the
efforts to pursue the turkish cause is seen by the victims of the first
genocide of the 20th century as a positive step.

armenian soldiers massacre hundreds of fleeing families.
the spiralling violence gripping the outer republics of the former
soviet union gained new impetus yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of
hundreds of women and children in war-racked nagorno-karabakh.
survivors reported that armenian soldiers shot and bayoneted more
than 450 azeris, many of them women and children, who were fleeing an
attack on their town. hundreds, possibly thousands, were missing and
feared dead.
the attackers killed most of the soldiers and volunteers defending
the women and children. they then turned their guns on the terrified
refugees. the few survivors later described what happened:"" that's when
the real slaughter began,"" said azer hajiev, one of three soldiers to
survive. ""the armenians just shot and shot. and then they came in and
started carving up people with their bayonets and knives.""
"" they were shooting, shooting, shooting"", echoed rasia aslanova, who
arrived in agdam with other women and children who made their way through
armenian lines. she said her husband, kayun, and a son-in-law were killed
in front of her. her daughter was still missing.
one boy who arrived in agdam had an ear sliced off.
the survivors said 2000 others, some of whom had fled separately,
were still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their
wounds or the cold.
by late yesterday, 479 deaths had been registered at the morgue in
agdam's morgue, and 29 bodies had been buried in the cemetery. of the
seven corpses i saw awaiting burial, two were children and three were
women, one shot through the chest at point blank range.
agdam hospital was a scene of carnage and terror. doctors said they
had 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with bullet injuries or deep
stab wounds.
nor were they safe in agdam. on friday night rockets fell on the city
which has a population of 150,000, destroying several buildings and
killing one person.

75928.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"i sure hope so. because, the unspeakable crimes of the armenians must
be righted. armenian invaders burned and sacked the fatherland of
urartus, massacred and exterminated its population and presented to
the world all those left from the urartus, as the armenian civilization.
all reliable western historians describe how armenians ruthlessly
exterminated 2.5 million muslim women, children and elderly people of
eastern anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of the
ottoman empire between 1914-1920.
it is unfortunately a truth that armenians are known as collaborators
of the nazis during world war ii and that, even today, criminal nazi
members of the asala sdpa arf terrorism triangle preach and instigate
racism, hatred, violence and terrorism among peoples.
and x-soviet armenia continues its anti-turkish policy in the following
ways:
1. x-soviet armenia denies the historical fact of the turkish genocide
in order to shift international public opinion away from its political
responsibility.
2. x-soviet armenia, employing asala sdpa arf terrorism and revisionism
triangle and criminal nazi armenians, attempts to call into question the
veracity of the turkish genocide.
3. x-soviet armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through
the asala sdpa arf terrorism and revisionism triangle in an attempt to
silence the turkish people's vehement demands and protests.
4. using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-soviet
armenia and its tools in the united states attempt to silence through
terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-turkish supporters
of the turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.
using all the aforementioned methods, the x-soviet armenian government
is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from
making the turkish case a contemporary issue.
yet despite the efforts of the x-soviet armenian government and its terrorist
and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle
of those whose closest ones were systematically exterminated by the armenians,
the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and
consequently a number of governments and organizations have become
supportive of the recognition of the turkish genocide.

""armenians watch their opportunity to kill turks and kurds, set fire
to their villages, and then make their escape into the mountains.""
are you people for real? the main legal principles of the turkish state
are summarized in article 2 of the constitution:
""the republic of turkey is a democratic, secular and social state
governed by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public
peace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights;
loyal to the nationalism of ataturk, and based on the fundamental
tenets set forth in the preamble of the constitution.""
freedom of culture and religion prevailed during the ottoman empire, allowing
the many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. the
fact that the ottoman empire was the longest lived in recent history may be
attributed to these freedoms, despite the lack of any written constitution.
the first attempts to create a written constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856.
although the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force
only temporarily, they provided the basic elements of a constitution.
the 1876 constitution was the first legal document to force a parliament and
the right of election to share the sovereignty of the emperor. the constitution
of 1906 placed some additional limitations on the emperor, while increasing
the power of the parliament and the government.
the first world war (1914-1918) brought the ottoman empire to an end. by the
occupation of istanbul, the parliament was dissolved and the constitution was
abolished. the members of parliament were sent to exile to an island by the
occupying forces.
during the independence war, the ""turkish grand national assembly"" held their
first meeting on april 23, 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new
turkish state. this assembly prepared the new legal structure of the turkish
republic. the new republic was proclaimed on october 29, 1923 and the new
constitution was adopted in 1924. that constitution served as the legal
backbone of today's modern turkish republic. in 1945, turkey adopted a
multi-party political system. the constitution of 1924 was replaced by
others in 1961 and 1982. all three constitutions of the republic have been
based on the principles of parliamentary democracy, human rights, national
sovereignty, division of powers, private ownership and secularization.
""major principles of the constitution""
the constitution (with 177 articles) establishes the structure of the republic
within the following principles:
- the turkish republic is a democratic, secular and social state governed by
law;
- it should be governed to maintain public peace, national solidarity, justice,
human rights and the objectives of ataturk;
- the language of the state is turkish;
- sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions.
sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation;
- legislative power is carried by the parliament elected by the nation. this
power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else;
- executive power is exercised by the president, and council of ministers;
- judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the
turkish nation;
- all individuals are equal, irrespective of language, race, religion, color,
sex, or political beliefs;
- laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the constitution.
""structure of the state""
in accordance with the constitution, the structure of the state is based on the
principle of ""division of power"" to create a balanced and self-controlled
system. the power is divided into ""legislative power,"" ""executive power,"" and
""judicial power,"" balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each
other (self-control).
a. legislative power:
the ""turkish grand national assembly"" is a parliament with one house, elected
by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on
behalf of the nation. the basic functions of this assembly are:
- to adopt, to amend, or to repeal laws;
- to approve or to dismiss the council of ministers;
- to supervise and to question ministers or the council of ministers;
- to debate, to amend and to approve annual budgets;
- to ratify international agreements;
- to grant amnesty or pardons.
members of parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral
or written) during the course of their legislative duties. the country is
divided into constituencies. the number of representatives of each is
calculated according to its population. every turkish citizen over the age
of twenty-one can vote.
elections are supervised by the ""supreme council of elections,"" which solves
all disputes or appeals. in each province, the local ""board of election""
runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the
supreme council. members of the council and boards are elected among
independent judges.
b. executive power:
the president of the republic is the head of state (not the head of government
as in the unites states). the main functions of the president are:
- to represent the state and the country;
- to insure the implementation of the constitution;
- to coordinate legislative, judicial and executive functions;
- act as the supreme commander of the armed forces;
- to ratify laws and government decrees.
the president is elected by the grand national assembly for a period of seven
years. the president may ratify or return the laws for a second debate, may
call for a referendum.
executive power is exercised by the ""council of ministers,"" headed by the
prime minister. the prime minister is appointed by the president from the
members of parliament. the prime minister names the ministers for approval
by the president. the new government (council of ministers) reads their
program at the parliament and the vote of confidence follows. there are 21 (?)
ministers in the council.
ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent
""administrative"" courts for their misuse of power, administrative errors or
functions against any law.
c. judicial power:
judicial power is exercised by independent courts. no authority or power can
instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts. these cannot be
discharged, replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the
reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws. there are three categories
of courts in the turkish judiciary system:
- courts of justice deal with legal, commercial and criminal cases. the
decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice
upon the appeal of the parties involved.
- the decisions or functions of the executive power (including the prime
minister and ministers or any governmental department) can be appealed in
administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law.
the decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the
high administrative court.
the laws and decisions of the grand national assembly can be examined by the
""constitutional court"" if they contradict the constitution. if found
contradictory, this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the parliament.

jews, fools, or anti-semites from jewish families.

ancestry who issues statements for a company or organization that
condemn judaism is perfectly sufficeint. i think a few years free of
their anti-semetic role models would do wonders for most of them.

since the answer is no, you're argument, while interestingly
constructed, is irrelevant. i will however, respond to a few points
you assert in the course of talking about anti-trust laws.
and those fleeing arab lands, where jews were second class
citizens.
jews often paid far more than fair market value for the land
they bought.
you know, sam, when people start talking about an
international jewish conspiracy, its really begins to sound like
anti-semitic bull.
the reason there is no conspiracy here is quite simple.
zionists made no bones about what was going on. there were
conferences, publications, etc, all talking about creating a national
home for the jews. ... because you've never heard of it, its dead? the fact is, you
claimed israel had to give arabs rights because of (non-existant)
international aid. then you see that that argument has a hole you
could drive a truck through, and again assert that israel is only
democratic within the (unexplained) constraints of one ethnic group.
the problem with that argument is that arabs are allowed to vote for
whoever they please. so, please tell me, sam, what constraints are
there on israeli democracy that don't exist in other democratic
states?
i've never heard anything about the khazakistani arab
population. does that mean that they have no history or roots? when
i was at ben gurion university in israel, one of my neighbors was an
israeli arab. he wasn't really all that different from my other
neighbors. does that make him dead or oppressed?
how recent is recent? i can probably build a case for a
jewish gaza city. it would be pretty silly, but i could do it. i'm
arguing not that jerusalem is jewish, but that land has no ethnicity.

'after all, who remembers today the extermination of the tartars?'
(adolf hitler, august 22, 1939: ruth w. rosenbaum (durusoy),

i refer to the turks and kurds as history's forgotten people. it does
not serve our society well when most people are totally unaware of
what happened in 1914 where a vicious society, run by fascist armenians,
decided to simply use the phoniest of pretexts as an excuse, for wiping
out a peace-loving, industrious, and very intelligent and productive
ethnic group. what we have is a demand from the fascist government of
x-soviet armenia to redress the wrongs that were done against our
people. and the only way we can do that is if we can catch hold of and
not lose sight of the historical precedence in this very century. we
cannot reverse the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to
keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the atlantic, so as
to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because
of their religion or their race. which means that i support the claims
of the turks and kurds to return to their lands in x-soviet armenia,
to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland.

showed up in that area. entire population of the region was subjected
to genocide beyond belief; genocide which was planned to exterminate
the whole turkish people of the region to the last man, woman and child.
armenians tortured and massacred millions of defenseless civilians. to
assemble innocent civilians in the mosques and burn them in the buildings
was one of their methods. even today the traveler in that region is seldom

too bad. in fact, by 1942, nazi armenians in europe had established
a vast network of pro-german collaborators, that extended over two
continents. thousands of armenians were serving the german army and
waffen-ss in russia and western europe. armenians were involved in
espionage and fifth-column activities for hitler in the balkans and
arabian peninsula. they were promised an 'independent' state under
german 'protection' in an agreement signed by the 'armenian national
council.' (a copy of this agreement can be found in the 'congressional
record,' november 1, 1945; see document 1.) on this side of the atlantic,
nazi armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. they had often
expressed pro-nazi sentiments until america entered the war. in summary,
during world war ii armenians were carried away with the german might and
cringing and fawning over the nazis. in that zeal, the armenian publication
in germany, hairenik, carried statements as follows: 1 ""sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the jews)
when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it
becomes necessary for a people (the nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon
method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. during the surgical
operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing.""

""...we have first hand information and evidence of armenian atrocities
against our people (jews)...members of our family witnessed the
murder of 148 members of our family near erzurum, turkey, by armenian
neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely jewish
and or muslim. armenians should look to their own history and see
the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors...
armenians were in league with hitler in the last war, on his premise
to grant them self government if, in return, the armenians would
help exterminate jews...armenians were also hearty proponents of
the anti-semitic acts in league with the russian communists. mr. amarian!

meeting,"" the armenian reporter, may 1, 1986, pp. 1 18.
athens, greece - an array of representatives of greek political parties,
including the ruling pasok party, and a host of political groups, both
armenian and non-armenian, joined to voice their solidarity with the
armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new
armenian political force were voiced here on sunday, april 20 during
the 2nd international meeting of solidarity with the armenian people. and
judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these
political groups and organizations, at least here in greece, the armenian
cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world.
the international meeting of solidarity was sponsored by the greek branch of
the armenian popular movement, a comparatively new political force headed
by younger generations of armenians, who openly profess their support of the
armed struggle and of the armenian secret army for the liberation of armenia
(asala). the organization has branches in various european and middle eastern
countries and the united states although some of these branches appear to
have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks
of asala...
voicing the support of pasok, the ruling party in greece, to the armenian
people, was mr. charalambidi michalis, a member of the central committee of
the party and the greek member of the permanent people's tribunal...
explaining the goals and aspirations of the armenian popular movement
was ara sarkisian. significant was the address delivered by mr. bassam
abu-salim, on behalf of the popular front for the movement's continued
support of the armenians' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause,
pledging that palestinian operated and run training camps would always be
open to armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. later, mr.
abu-salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that
his organization had always trained armenian members of asala and that
this policy will continue. ""the doors of our camps are always open to
armenian freedom fighters,"" he affirmed.
among the prominent greek politicians who attended the conference was the son
of prime minister papandreou, who himself holds a post in the greek cabinet;
two members of the cypriot parliament who had journeyed to athens for the
specific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of
the christian democratic party, edik center party, two wings of the communist
party, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations,
a number of mayors of greek towns and cities; two greek members of the
european parliament and other members of the greek parliament were also among
those who participated in the international conference. also on hand to follow
the deliberations was the ambassador of bulgaria in athens.
more than significant was the large number of messages received by the
organizers, including the following: palestinian national revolutionary
movement, fatah; popular front for the liberation of palestine-general
command; the central committee of the palestinian national liberation
movement-fatah; the socialist progressive party of lebanon; arab socialist
labor party; the kurdistan democratic union of iraq; and numerous other
international groups, all noted for their radical stand in the israeli-
palestinian conflict.
support from arf-rm
among messages received from armenian groups was the armenian revolutionary
federation-revolutionary movement, the group that has claimed the abduction
and assassination of key party leaders in lebanon accused of selling out to
foreign interests and powers. the message clearly gave its support to the
armenian popular movement pledging that the revolutionary movement will
continue to ""reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,""
to expose the anti-armenian activities of the leaders of the dashnag ""bureau.""
the message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that
exists between the dissident dashnag group and the armenian popular movement,
open supporters of asala and armed struggle.
the armenian popular movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the
greek capital, known as neos kosmos, where there is a large armenian presence.
the headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have
turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of armenian youth, who
prefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...

please, can you tell us why those quotes are ""crap""?..because you do not
like them!!!...because they really exist...why?
as i said in my previous posting, those quotes exactly exist in the source
given by serdar argic ..
you couldn't reject it...
here we go again..
in the book i have, both the front page and the author's preface give
the same year: 1923 and 15 january, 1923, respectively!
(anyone can check it at her his library,if not, i can send you the copies of
pages, please ask by sct)
i really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924)
what i care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in
the given quotes by serdar argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your
groundless accussations, etc. ... i claim i have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)
and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published
in 1934(serdar argic's reference) has..you couldn't reject it..but, now you
are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..
let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)
first you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..you
called serdar argic a liar!..
i said to you, no, mr.davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...
(i even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)
and now, you are lying again and talking about ""modified,re-published book""
(without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..
(by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was
first published in 1924(your claim).i am sure that you have some 'pretty
well suited theories', as usual)
and i am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who
wants to compare the fact and mr.davidian's lies...i also give the call number
and page numbers again for the library use, which are:
949.6 r 198
and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215
now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying ""it is
not possible..."" ..if not, what is your point?
differences in the number of pages?
mine was published in 1923..serdar argic's was in 1934..
no need to use the same book size and the same letter
charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!
the issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year
first published..
and you tried to hide the whole point..
the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about
how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by armenians..and those quotes given
by serdar argic exist!!
it was the issue, wasn't-it?
you were not able to object it...does it bother you anyway?
you name all these tortures and murders (by armenians) as a ""crap""..
people who think like you are among the main reasons why the world still
has so many ""craps"" in the 1993.
any question?

the fruits of that genocide. and your criminal organization will not get away
with the genocide's cover-up. in june 1915, a major uprising took place in
sebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous nazi boyadjian. the moslem
districts were burnt down. hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killed
and hundreds of civilians also perished.
armenians first of all occupied the talori region, which included
the villages of siner, simai, gulli-guzat, ahi, hedenk, sinank,
ekind, effard, musson, etek, akcesser. leaving their wives,
children and property in these inaccessible spots, the armenians
joined forces with other armed bands coming from the silvan
districts in the plain of mus, after which the whole body of
3000 men gathered in the andok mt. five or six hundred wished
to surround mus, and started off by attacking the delican tribe to
the south of the city. they slaughtered a number of the tribe and
seized their goods. the religious beliefs of the muslims who fell
into their hands were derided and disparaged, and the muslims
themselves murdered in the most frightful manner. the rebels
also attacked the regular troops in the vicinity of mus, but the
large numbers of the regular forces prevented them from
occupying the city.
the rebels joined the bandits in the andok mts., carrying out
the most frightful massacres and looting among the tribes of the
neighbourhood. they burned omer agha's nephew alive. they
raped a number of turkish women at a spot three or four hours'
distance from gulli-guzat and then strangled them.
at the beginning of august the rebels attacked the faninar,
bekiran and badikan tribes, perpetrating equally horrible
atrocities. the rebels in the villages of yermut and ealigernuk in
the nahiye of cinan in the kaza of cal attacked the kurds in the
neighbourhood, as well as the villages of kaisser and catcat.
towards the end of august, the armenians attacked the
kurds in the vicinity of mus and burned down three or four
villages, including gulli-guzat. as for the 3000 rebels in talori,
they continued to spread death and destruction among the
muslims and other christian communities, refusing to lay down
their arms.

major-generals, posen, october 4 1943 ""nazi conspiracy and aggression"", vol. iv, p. 559 one basic principal must be the absolute rule for the ss man: we
must be honest, decent, loyal, and comradely to members of our own
blood and to nobody else. what happens to a russian, to a czech,
does not interest me in the slightest. what the nations can offer
in good blood of our type, we will take, if necessary by kidnapping
their children and raising them with us. whether nations live in
prosperity or starve to death interests me only in so far as we
need them as slaves for our culture; otherwise, it is of no interest
to me. whether 10,000 russian females fall down from exhaustion
while digging an anti-tank ditch interest me only in so far as
the anti-tank ditch for germany is finished. we shall never be rough
and heartless when it is not necessary, that is clear. we germans,
who are the only people in the world who have a decent attitude
towards animals, will also assume a decent attitude towards these
human animals. but it is a crime against our own blood to worry
about them and give them ideals, thus causing our sons and
grandsons to have a more difficult time with them. when someone
comes to me and says, ""i cannot dig the anti-tank ditch with women
and children, it is inhuman, for it will kill them"", then i
would have to say, ""you are a murderer of your own blood because
if the anti-tank ditch is not dug, german soldiers will die, and
they are the sons of german mothers. they are our own blood"".
extract from himmler's address to party comrades, september 7 1940 ""trials of wa criminals"", vol. iv, p. 1140 if any pole has any sexual dealing with a german woman, and by this
i mean sexual intercourse, then the man will be hanged right in
front of his camp. then the others will not do it. besides,
provisions will be made that a sufficient number of polish women
and girls will come along as well so that a necessity of this
kind is out of the question.
the women will be brought before the courts without mercy, and
where the facts are not sufficiently proved - such borderline
cases always happen - they will be sent to a concentration camp.
this we must do, unless these one million poles and those
hundreds of thousands of workers of alien blood are to inflict
untold damage on the german blood. philosophizing is of no avail
in this case. it would be better if we did not have them at all -
we all know that - but we need them.

interesting statement. especially when you consider that lebanon
had claimed to have made progress in the peace talks, as well as
israel. of course, one of the prime obstacles to israel's complete
withdrawal is the lack of governmental control that can be applied
to the area as well as the large presence of syrian forces which
have not been asked to withdraw as well.

75956.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"well, if you put things into historical perspective, the turks
moved into an area, which was inhabited by greeks. this is how the history
between the two nations started some centuries ago. since then, it has been
a continuous battle between the two nations. from my perspective i can't see
why i should say that greeks have been responsible for what has happened
between the two nations. of course, it would not be reasonable to argue that
the hostility should drag till we kick the turks out of this area. this isn't
going to happen, so the best would be to improve the relations between the two
countries. a golden oportunity exists with cyprus. if things can't work
there, there isn't any possible way that could work between our nations.
i always avoid to discuss such things. i consider it a waist of my time.
besides, as i said, i do not want to open a new flame.
i thought it was a smart move to receive more money from greek tourists.
i bet that this week there should be about 200,000 tourists from greece
in turkey. each one will leave at least 1,000 so go and figure what this
means to your economy. if you had kept the visa requirement, how many
greeks would bother to visit turkey?
come on. do not extrapolate from your limited personal experience. you err
if you think you'd get a reasonable conclusion.

75957.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"farid in support of the preservation of the territorial integrity of farid azerbaijan and its independence from russian rule, the iranians which farid includes millions of azerbaijanis will have armenia retreat from the farid territory of azerbaijan.
oh, they will? this should prove quite interesting! farid to count on iranian help to supposedly counter turkish influence will farid be a fatal error on the part of armenia as long as armenia in farid violation of international law has azerbaijani lands in occupation.
armenia is not counting on iranian help. as far as violations of international
laws, which international law gives azerbaijan the right to attack and
depopulate the armenians in karabakh? farid if armenian aggression continues in the territory of azerbaijan, not farid only there won't be any aid from iran to armenia but also steps will farid be taken to have armenian army back in armenia.
and who do you speak for? rafsanjani? farid the azerbaijanis of iran will be the guarantors of this policy. as for farid scaring iranians or turks from the russian power, experts on present farid and future military potentials of these people would not put much farid stock on the russain power as the sole power in the region for long!!!
well, farid, your supposed experts are not expert! the russians have had
non-stop influence in the caucasus since the treaty of turkmanchay in 1828.
hmm... that makes it 1993-1828 165 years!
oh, i see the azeris from iran are going to force out the armenians from
karabakh! that will be a real good trick! farid iran is not alian to developing the capability to produce the a bomb farid and a reliable delivery system (refer to recent news releases farid regarding the potential of iran).
so the azeris from iran are going to force the armenians from karabakh by
forcing the iranian government to drop an atomic bomb on these armenians. farid the moral of the story is that, you don't go invading your neighbor's farid home (azerbaijan) and flash russia's guns when questioned about it.
oh, but it's just fine if you drop an atomic bomb on your neighbor! you are
a damn fool, farid! farid (marshal shapashnikov may have to eat his words regarding turkey in a farid few short years!).
so you are going to drop an atomic bomb on russia as well. farid peaceful resolution of the armenian-azerbaijani conflict is the only farid way to go. armenia may soon find the fruits of aggression very bitter farid indeed.
and the armenians will take your ""peaceful"" dropping of an atomic bomb as
an example of iranian azeri benevolence! you sir are a poor example of an
iranian azeri!
ha! and to think i had a nice two day stay in tabriz back in 1978!

75958.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"living through those days at the age of 20 and following
the internal and external news gives me that knowledge
and position. in 1974, turkey had a democratic goverment and free
press at that time. forget about internal news agencies, i haven't
heard anything from any international source about any
concentration camps with greek cypriot prisoners in turkey.
however, i heard adana pow camp. it was not secret and well
recognized pow camp.
i see, they vanished in turkish labor camps. turks have
decided to acknowledge their existence first but later
changed their minds releasing them. is that it? what do
you think happened to them? i thought that mia's are only the subject
of rambo and chuck noris movies. seems that i am wrong.
you don't need to belive me. turkiye was never a clandestine state
in its history, it has been a respected and continuous member of un
since the inception of un. no body ever questioned the un membership of
turkey because of what had happened in 1974a and after. only a short
lived arms embargo was imposed unilaterally by usa to satisfy the
internal greek loby. i know what you would say next. let me answer it
before wasting anytime. yes! un had a few condemning resolutions
against turkey because of handling the cyprus problem, especially after
the 1980 coup. well, us and israel had a few too. what can i say?
i am sure during athens junta duruing 1960-74, greeks had
their own share too.
have you looked at the latest un agenda for cyprus talks
mediated by gali? there was no issue whatsoever about any
missing people among the negotiating parties. was there?
i heard many times from denktas interviews by turkish and
international press. he keeps saying that ""this was no
longer an issue for peace talks."" also, you don't want
me fish for the greek cypriot politician's words (that argic
had posted zillion times) describing missing peoples as
a greek-cypriot myth. seems that there is a different opinions
among greek-cypriots as well about missing people in turkish
custody. .. i am not claiming anything. i just told you what was
given to greek cypriots as an answer by turkish
goverment turkish cypriots when they wanted to locate some
of their own between july 15 and the final cease-fire in
late august, 1974. this answer seems to satisfy the international
community, the un, and the vasilu goverment (since he did not make it
an issue for the peace talks). also, i am not aware of any un
condemnation against turkey about any missing greek-cypriot. are you?
btw, do you mean that nicos sampson had a bloodless coup d'eta
and nobody got hurt in those events?
like i said before. there is even a different opinion among
greek-cypriots for this myth. the officers in turkish army who
governed the adana pow camp must be hell of clever dudes
to cover up their tracks 8-). i hope turkish army does't have
same type of morons for the security of turkiye. however, this must
a good subject for a movie script. one should inform oliver stone
about this. if this is what you understood from the paragraph above,
you better let your computer system administrator check
the character conversion tables in your system. if yours are
ok, i should inform mine 8-).

75959.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"i guess, i didn't make my point clear. in the case of israel government, it
is not only tough talk for its intimidation policy. after all, not many
people are intimidated just by talking. here how it goes: tough talks,
followed by aggressive actions followed by taking pride of those actions and
bragging about them."
75960.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"boy, you really are a stupid person. our justice department does
not sentence people to death. that's up to state courts. again,
get a brain."
75961.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"i am. i was back in my home village this last summer. for your information
we are people, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists. most of the
people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily
business, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others are
older men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee. is that so hard to
imagine ???? it is not a ""terrorist camp"" as you and the israelis like
to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer
in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....
some young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of
the lebanese resistance. even the inhabitants of the village do not
know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often
suspect who they are and what they are up to. these young men are
supported financially by iran most of the time. they sneak arms and
ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps
for israeli patrols. every time an israeli soldier is killed or injured
by these traps, israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages
of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians. once they
are back they announce that they bombed a ""terrorist hideout"" where
an 8 year old girl just happened to be.
we are now accustomed to israeli tactics, and we figure that this is
the israeli way of telling us that ""if you're gonna hurt our soldiers
you're gonna pay the price"". we accept this as a price we have to pay
to free our land, israel knows very well that it is not really hurting
the resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather
just keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young
men to stop attacking israeli soldiers since these attacks are
taking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers.
israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that
we have come to accept and deal with, the lebanese resistance
on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on occupying
israeli soldiers until they withdraw, this is the only real
leverage that they have to force israel to withdraw.
the people of south lebanon are occupied, or shelled by israel on a
regular basis. we do not want to be occupied. if israel insists that
the so called ""security zone"" is necessary for the protection of
northern israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation
with the blood of its soldiers. if israel is interested in peace,
than it should withdraw from our land. we are not asking for the
establishment of a lebanese occupied zone in northern israel to protect
our villages that are attacked on a regular basis by israel, so the
best policy seems to be the removal of israeli occupation and the
establishment of peace keeping troops along the border.
i have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only
real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace
settlement whereby israel withdraws to its own borders and
peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure
no one on either side of the border is shelled.
this is the only realistic solution, it is time for israel to
realize that the concept of a ""buffer zone"" aimed at protecting
its northern cities has failed. in fact it has caused much more
israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of northern israel
would have resulted in.
if israel really wants to save some israeli lives it would withdraw
unilaterally from the so-called ""security zone"" before the conclusion
of the peace talks. such a move would save israeli lives,
advance peace efforts, give israel a great moral lift, better israel's
public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations
since israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in
peace and has already offered some important concessions.
along with such a withdrawal israel could demand that hizbollah
be disarmed by the lebanese government and warn that it will not
accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a
shelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone
and will hold the lebanese and syrian government responsible for it.
there seems to be very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese
goovernment to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such
circumstances, and now the lebanese government has proven that it is
capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did
in all other parts of lebanon.
i agree, only in the case of the isareli soldiers their killing
cannot be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.
i have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make
yes, we have no quarrel with jews, or israeli civilians.
the real problem is with occupying israeli soldiers and those brave
israeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an
occupying soldier is attacked.

from a libyan televison interview with yasser arafat 7-19-1991
q: some people say that the palestinian revolution has many times changed
its strategies and tactics, something which has left its imprint on the
palestinian problem and on the palestinian liberation front. the strategies and tactics have not been clear. the question is, is the
direction of the palestinian problem clear? the palestinian leadership
has stopped, or at least this is what has been said in the media, this
happened on the way to the dialogue with the united states, the plo
recognized something called ""israel""...
a: no, no, no! we do not recognize the state of israel. we said
""recognition"" -- when a palestinian state is established. it will then
decide if to recognize israel or not. when it is established, its
parliament will convene and decide.
and replace them with what? if israel is to withdraw its
control of any territory, there must be two prerequsites. one is that
it leads to a reduction in deaths. the second is that it should not
weaken israels bargianing position with respect to peace talks.
leaving gaza unilateraly is a bad idea because it encourages
arabs to think they can get what they want by killing jews. the only
way israel should pull out of gaza is at the end of negotiations.
these negotiations should lead to a mutually agreeable solution with
security guarantees for both sides.
until arabs are ready to sit down at the table and talk again,
they should not expect, or recieve more concessions.

from fighting back is to stop attacking. if there were no attacks in

tell me something, though. why do syrian troops not get

conditions. one is a demonstration that the lebanese army can keep

this is not to devalue the actions of the resistance

israel has repeatedly stated that it will leave when the

when the syrians agree to leave.
the lebanese have not tried diplomacy for very long, or maybe
they're not capable of getting rid of the syrians and iranians who

prolong israels stay in south lebanon.
if the lebanese army was able to maintain the peace, then
israel would not have to be there. until it is, israel prefers that
its soldiers die rather than its children.
israel should withdraw from lebanon when a peace treaty is
signed. not a day before. withdraw because of casualties would tell
the lebanese people that all they need to do to push israel around is
kill a few soldiers. its not gonna happen.
why should israel not demand this while holding the buffer
zone? it seems to me that the better bargaining position is while
holding your neighbors land. if lebanon were willing to agree to
those conditions, israel would quite probably have left already.

75981.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"this a ""tried and true"" method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups:
to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace, thus forcing the
opposing ""state"" to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or,
in order to avoid the deaths of civilians, abandon the search. certainly the
people who use the population for cover are also to blaim for dragging the
innocent civilians into harm's way.
are you suggesting that, when guerillas use the population for cover, israel
should totally back down? so...the easiest way to get away with attacking
another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects
innocent lives?
your damn right israel insists on some sort of ""demilitarized"" or ""buffer""
zone. its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory
of arab states and watched as the states did nothing. it is not exactly
surprizing that israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to
do it themselves.
what? so the whole bit about attacks on israel from neighboring arab states
can start all over again? while i also hope for this to happen, it will
only occur when arab states show that they are prepared to take on the
responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on israel from their
soil. they have to prove it (or provide some ""guaratees""), there is no way
israel is going to accept their ""word""- not with their past attitude of
tolerance towards ""anti-israel guerillas in-residence"".
good lord, brad. what in the world goves you the idea that un troops stop
anything? they are only stationed in a country because that country allows
them in. it can ask them to leave at any time ; as nasser did in '56 and
'67. somehow, with that ""limitation"" on the troops ""powers"" i don't
think that israel is going to be any more comfortable. without a genuine commitment to peace from the arab states, and concrete (not intellectual or political exercises in jargon) ""guarantees"" by other parties, the un is worthless
to israel (but, perhaps useful as a ""ruse""?).
perhaps you are aware that, to most communities of people, there is
the feeling that it is better that ""many of us die fighting
against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently
accept our fate."" if,however, you call on israel to see the sense of
suffering fewer casualties, i suggest you apply the same to palestinian,
arab and islamic groups.
from israel's perspective, ""concessions"" gets it nothing...except the
realization that it has given ""something"" up and now can only
hope that the other side decides to do likewise. words can be taken
back by merely doing so; to ""take back"" tangible items (land,
control of land) requires the sort of action you say israel should
stay away from.
israel put up with attacks from arab state territories for decades
before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of lebanon.
the entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) israel
would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the arab state
involved, 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter, secure
in the knowledge that it could not be held responsible for the acts
committed by ""private groups"", 3) israel would prepare for the next
round of attacks. what would israel want to return to those days (and
don't be so idiotic as to suggest ""trust"" for the motivations of
present-day arab states)?
ah, ok...what is ""different"" about the present situation that tells
us that the arab states will not pursue their past antagonistic
policies towards israel? now, don't talk about vague ""political factors""
but about those ""tangible"" (just like that which israel gave up)
factors that ""guarantee"" the responsibility of those states. your
assessment of ""difference"" here is based on a whole lot of assumptions,
and most states don't feel confortable basing their existence on that
sort of thing.
it has not. without the support, and active involvement, of syria,
lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred.
once syria leaves who is to say that lebanon will be able to retain
control? if syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for israel.
tim
your view of this entire matter is far too serenely one-sided and
selectively naive."
75982.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"i agree that the death of three soldiers on a patrol etc... is
not terrorism. that having been said, lets continue. snip imagine ???? it is not a ""terrorist camp"" as you and the israelis like
to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer
in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....
i would not argue that all or even most of the villages are ""terrorist
camps"". there are however some which come very close to serving that
purpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way
prior to the invasion.
some young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of
the lebanese resistance. even the inhabitants of the village do not
know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often
suspect who they are and what they are up to. these young men are
supported financially by iran most of the time. they sneak arms and
ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps
for israeli patrols. every time an israeli soldier is killed or injured
by these traps, israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages
of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians. once they
are back they announce that they bombed a ""terrorist hideout"" where
an 8 year old girl just happened to be.
some of the villages, and yours might well be among them, are as you
describe. not all are. there are a large number of groups in the area,
backed by various organizations, with a wide range of purposes. hizbollah
and amal were two of the larger ones and may still be. as to retaliation,
while mistakes may be made, that is still a far cry from indiscriminate
bombing, which would have produced major casualties.
israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that
we have come to accept and deal with, the lebanese resistance
on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on occupying
israeli soldiers until they withdraw, this is the only real
leverage that they have to force israel to withdraw.
well, here we disagree. i think that israel would willingly withdraw if
the lebanese gov't was able to field a reliable force in the area to police
it and prevent further attacks.
this is the only realistic solution, it is time for israel to
realize that the concept of a ""buffer zone"" aimed at protecting
its northern cities has failed. in fact it has caused much more
israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of northern israel
would have resulted in.
actually that is not clear at all. i will agree that the death toll is no
longer civilian and now primarily military though.
there seems to be very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese
goovernment to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such
circumstances, and now the lebanese government has proven that it is
capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did
in all other parts of lebanon.
no, the syrian gov't is more than happy to have israel sink into another
lebanese morass. i could elaborate if necessary.
i agree, only in the case of the isareli soldiers their killing
cannot be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.
no, but it is regretable, as is the whole situation.

a genocide is a deliberate and organized massacre of people in an
attempt to exterminate a race. this is the worst crime in history.
it happened to the turks in eastern anatolia and the armenian
dictatorship. 2.5 million turks and kurds were killed in the worst
ways imaginable. it is sickening to think that the human race is capable
of such actions, but there is no denying the fact that the armenian
genocide of 2.5 million muslims happened.
people of turkiye deeply sympathize with those whose relatives were
killed in the turkish genocide. i understand their anger that there
are those who still deny that the turkish genocide indeed took place,
despite the fact that the genocide of 2.5 million turks has been
well documented over the past six decades. we cannot reverse
the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to keep the
memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the atlantic, so as
to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people

turkiye know quite well that greece and the greek cypriots will never
abandon the idea of hellenizing cyprus and will remain eternally
hopeful of uniting it with greece, someday, whatever the cost to the

following the greek cypriot attempt to annex the island to greece with
the aid of the greek army, turkiye intervened by using her legal right
given by two international agreements. turkiye did it for the frequently

those turkish cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island
since 1571.
the release of nikos sampson, a member of eoka national organization

in cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to
destroy the island's independence by annexing it to greece. of

for this irresponsible conduct.

the cyprus turkish army contingent. during the attacks launched
against the turks by the greeks, on 20th december 1963, dr. nihat
ilhan's wife and three children were ruthlessly and brutally
killed in the bathroom, where they had tried to hide, by savage
greeks. dr. nihat ilhan happened to be on duty that night, the
24th december 1963. pictures reflecting greek atrocities
committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which
has been converted into a museum.
an eye-witness account of how a turkish family was butchered by
greek terrorists
the date is the 24th of december, 1963... the onslaught of the
greeks against the turks, which started three days ago, has been
going on with all its ferocity; and defenseless women, old men
and children are being brutally killed by greeks. and now kumsal
area of nicosia witnesses the worst example of the greeks savage
bloodshed...
the wife and the three infant children of dr. nihat ilhan, a
major on duty at the camp of the cyprus turkish army contingent,
are mercilessly and dastardly shot dead while hiding in the
bathroom of their house, by maddened greeks who broke into their
home. a glaring example of greek barbarism.
let us now listen to the relating of the said incident told by
mr. hasan yusuf gudum, an eye witness, who himself was wounded
during the same terrible event.
""on the night of the 24th of december, 1963 my wife feride hasan
and i were paying a visit to the family of major dr. nihat ilhan.
our neighbours mrs. ayshe of mora, her daughter ishin and mrs.
ayshe's sister novber were also with us. we were all sitting
having supper. all of a sudden bullets from the pedieos river
direction started to riddle the house, sounding like heavy rain.
thinking that the dining-room where we were sitting was
dangerous, we ran to the bathroom and toilet which we thought
would be safer. altogether we were nine persons. we all hid in
the bathroom except my wife who took refuge in the toilet. we
waited in fear. mrs. ilhan the wife of major doctor, was standing
in the bath with her three children murat, kutsi and hakan in her
arms. suddenly with a great noise we heard the front door open.
greeks had come in and were combing, every corner of the house
with their machine gun bullets. during these moments i heard
voices saying, in greek, ""you want taksim eh!"" and then bullets
started flying in the bathroom. mrs. ilhan and her three children
fell into the bath. they were shot. at this moment the greeks,
who broke into the bathroom, emptied their guns on us again. i
heard one of the major's children moan, then i fainted.
when i came to myself 2 or 3 hours later, i saw mrs. ilhan and
her three children lying dead in the bath. i and the rest of the
neighbours in the bathroom were all seriously wounded. but what
had happened to my wife? then i remembered and immediately ran to
the toilet, where, in the doorway, i saw her body. she was
brutally murdered.
in the street admist the sound of shots i heard voices crying
""help, help. is there no one to save us?"" i became terrified. i
thought that if the greeks came again and found that i was not
dead they would kill me. so i ran to the bedroom and hid myself
under the double-bed.
an our passed by. in the distance i could still hear shots. my
mouth was dry, so i came out from under the bed and drank some
water. then i put some sweets in my pocket and went back to the
bathroom, which was exactly as i had left in an hour ago. there i
offered sweets to mrs. ayshe, her daughter and mrs. novber who
were all wounded.
we waited in the bathroom until 5 o'clock in the morning. i
thought morning would never come. we were all wounded and needed
to be taken to hospital. finally, as we could walk, mrs. novber
and i, went out into the street hoping to find help, and walked
as far as koshklu chiftlik.
there, we met some people who took us to hospital where we were
operated on. when i regained my consciousness i said that there
were more wounded in the house and they went and brought mrs.
ayshe and her daughter.
after staying three days in the hospital i was sent by plane to
ankara for further treatment. there i have had four months
treatment but still i cannot use my arm. on my return to cyprus,
greeks arrested me at the airport.
all i have related to you above i told the greeks during my
detention. they then released me.""

we went tonight into the sealed-off turkish quarter of nicosia in
which 200 to 300 people have been slaughtered in the last five
days.
we were the first western reporters there, and we saw some
terrible sights.
in the kumsal quarter at no. 2, irfan bey sokagi, we made our way
into a house whose floors were covered with broken glass. a
child's bicycle lay in a corner.
in the bathroom, looking like a group of waxworks, were three
children piled on top of their murdered mother.
in a room next to it we glimpsed the body of a woman shot in the
head.
this, we were told, was the home of a turkish army major whose
family had been killed by the mob in the first violence.
today was five days later, and still they lay there.

and when i came across the turkish homes they were an appalling sight.
apart from the walls, they just did not exist. i doubt if a napalm bomb
attack could have created more devastation. i counted 40 blackened brick
and concrete shells that had once been homes. each house had been deliberately
fired by petrol. under red tile roofs which had caved in, i found a twisted
mass of bed springs, children's conts and cribs, and ankle deep grey
ashes of what had once been chairs, tables and wardrobes.
in the neighbouring village of ayios vassilios, a mile away, i counted 16
wrecked and burned out homes. they were all turkish cypriot homes. from
this village more than 100 turkish cypriots had also vanished.in neither village
did i find a scrap of damage to any greek cypriot house.

75988.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"they are news because they are the exceptions. and the 'islamic holocaust'
is much the topic of the day. the historical evidence proves that during
the period of 1914 to 1920, the armenian government ordered, incited,
assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million muslim people
because of race, religion and national origin. armenians perpetrated acts
of sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes,
set up ambushes, attacked security stations and small turkish outposts
behind the ottoman army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly
attacked turkish and kurdish villages, slaughtering the turkish population
indiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike. innocent
muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with
axes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt
alive as can be seen below.
widespread armenian massacres of innocent muslims took place in regions
of van, kars, sivas, erzurum, bitlis, erzincan, mus, diyarbakir and
maras. the ottoman army, while fighting to prevent the russian invasion,
also had to deal with armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from
behind. the armenian genocide of the muslims spread to all parts of
eastern anatolia. starting from late 1914, armenians committed
widespread massacres and genocide in eastern anatolia, because the arena
was left to the armenians. almost every turkish town and village from
erzincan up to azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide
by armenians and the turkish genocide has been documented by armenian,
russian, american, british, ottoman, german, austrian and french
journalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century
committed by the blood-thirsty armenian genocide squads.
the ottoman army, liberating trabzon, bayburt, erzincan, erzurum,
kars and other regions from the russians, saw that the cities and their
villages had been destroyed and burnt, people slaughtered, massacred.
the massacres conducted by armenians, which became a black stain for
humanity, shocked and disgusted even the russian, british, german,
austrian, french and american authorities.
almost every ottoman document is related to armenian massacres and
cruelties. the inhuman treatment, cruelties, atrocities, genocide by
armenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent moslem turkish
and kurdish people, are sufficiently reflected in historical documents.
even today over seventy-five years later, the terrifying screams of
the victims of these cruelties can be heard.

erzincan to erzurum are destroyed. corpses of turks brutally and cruelly
slain are everywhere. according to accounts by those who were able to
save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful
events begun when the russian forces evacuated the places which were then
taken over by armenian gangs. the russians usually treated the people
well, but the people feared the intervention of the armenians. once these
places had been taken over by the armenians, however, the massacres begun.
they clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the
armenian and kurdish land from the turks and thus, solve the nationality

who had escaped from russian prison camps and come from kars and

turks and there were clashes between russian officers and armenian gangs.
i am now in erzurum, and what i see is terrible. almost the whole city is
destroyed. the smell of the corpses still fills the air. although there are
speculations that armenian gangs murdered austrian and german prisoners as
well, i could not get the supporting evidence in this regard, but there is
proof of murdering of turkish prisoners of war.""

ankara, turkey (upi) -- turkey is arming azerbaijan with light weapons to help
it fight armenian forces in the struggle for the nagorno- karabakh enclave,
the newspaper hurriyet said thursday.
deputy prime minister erdal inonu told reporters in ankara that turkey was
responding positively to a request from azerbaijan for assistance.
""we are giving a positive response to all requests"" from azerbaijan, ""within
the limits of our capabilities,"" he said.
foreign ministry spokesman vural valkan declined to elaborate on the nature
of the aid being sent to azerbaijan, but said they were within the framework
of the council for security and cooperation in europe.
hurriyet, published in istanbul, said turkey was sending light weapons to
azerbaijan, including rockets, rocket launchers and ammunition.
ankara began sending the hardware after a visit to turkey last week by a
high-ranking azerbaijani official. turkey has however ruled out, for the second
time in one week, that it would intervene militarily in azerbaijan.
wednesday, inonu told reporters ankara would not allow azerbaijan to suffer
defeat at the hands of the armenians. ""we feel ourselves bound to help
azerbaijan, but i am not in a position right now to tell you what form (that)
help may take in the future,"" he said.
he said turkish aid to azerbaijan was continuing, ""and the whole world knows
about it.""
prime minister suleyman demirel reiterated that turkey would not get
militarily involved in the conflict. foreign policy decisions could not be
based on street-level excitement, he said.
there was no immediate reaction in ankara to regional reports, based on
armenian sources in yerevan, saying turkish pilots and other officers were
captured when they were shot down flying azerbaijani warplanes and
helicopters.
the newspaper cumhuriyet said turkish troops were digging in along the border
with armenia, but military sources denied reports based on claims by local
people that gunfire was heard along the border. no military action has
occurred, the sources said.
the latest upsurge in fighting between the armenians and azerbaijanis flared
early this month when armenian forces seized the town of kelbajar and later
positioned themselves outside fizuli, near the iranian border.

75993.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"basically the problem is that israel may remain, or leave, the occupied
territories; it cannot do both, it cannot do neither. so far, israe
continues to propose that they remain. the palestinians propose that they
leave. why should either change their view? it is worth pointing out that
the only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a
reduction in the israeli presence. israel proposes no such reduction....
and in fact may be said to not be negotiating.
tim:
there seem to be two perceptions that have to be addressed . the
first is that of israel, where there is little trust for arab groups, so
there is little support for israel giving up tangible assets in
exchange for pieces of paper, ""expectations"", ""hopes"", etc. the second
is that of the arab world palestinians, where there is the demand that
these ""tangible concessions"" be made by israel without it receiving
anything tangible back. given this, the gap between the two stances
seems to be the need by israel of receiving some tangible returns
for its expected concessions. by ""tangible"" is meant something that
1) provides israel with ""comparable"" protection (from the land it is to
give up), 2) in some way ensures that the arab states and palestine will be accountable and held actively (not just ""diplomatically)
responsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory (by citizens
or ""visitors"").
in essence i do not believe that israel objections to palestinian
statehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now if israel
was assured that any new palestinian state would be committed to co-existing with israel and held responsible for all attacks on israel
from its territory.
aside from some of the rather slanted proposals above,
how could such ""guarantees"" be instilled? for example,
how could such ""guarantees"" ""controls"" be added to the
palestinian pisga proposals?
israel is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute
it lets go (gives lands back to arab states, no more ""buffer zone"", gives
full autonomy to palestinians), any and or all of the arab parties
could (and would , if not ""controlled"" somehow) easily return to the
traditional anti-israel position. the question then is how to really ensure that that will not happen.

associated press writer
gussar, azerbaijan (ap) -- the 600,000 lezghis of azerbaijan and russia have
begun clamoring for their own state, threatening turmoil in a tranquil corner
of the caucasus.
the region has escaped the ethnic warfare of neighboring nagorno-karabakh,
abkhazia and ossetia, but lezhgis could become the next minority in the former
soviet union to fight for independence.
lezghis, who are muslim descendents of nomadic shepherds, are angry about the
conscription of their young men to fight in azerbaijan's 5-year-old undeclared
war with armenia.
they also want to unite the lezghi regions of azerbaijan and russia, which
were effectively one until the breakup of the soviet union created national
borders that had been only lines on a map.
a rally of more than 3,000 lezghis in march to protest conscription and
demand a separate ""lezghistan"" alarmed the azerbaijani government.
officials in baku, the capital, deny rumors that police shot six
demonstrators to death. but the government announced strict security measures
and began cooperating with russian authorities to control the movement of
lezhgis living across the border in the dagestan region of russia.
visitors to gussar, the center of lezhgi life, found the town quiet soon
after the protest. children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air.
at the sunday bazaar, men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered to
discuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the russian border to a
war they say is not theirs.
""i have been drafted, but i won't go,"" said shamil kadimov, gold teeth
glinting in the sun. ""why must i fight a war for the azerbaijanis? i have
nothing to do with armenia.""
more than 3,000 people have died in the war, which centers on the disputed
territory of nagorno-karabakh, about 150 miles to the southeast.
malik kerimov, an official in the mayor's office, said only 11 of 300 locals
drafted in 1992 had served.
""the police don't force people to go,"" he said. ""they are afraid of an
uprising that could be backed by lezghis in dagestan.""
all the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators, but
disagreed on how the protest came about.
some said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that azerbaijan was
about to draft 1,500 men from the gussar region, where 75,000 lezghis live.
others said the rally was ordered by gen. muhieddin kahramanov, leader of the
lezhgi underground separatist movement, sadval, based in dagestan.
""we organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught about
draft orders,"" said kerim babayev, a mathematics teacher who belongs to sadval.
""we hope to reunite peacefully, by approaching everyone -- the azerbaijanis,
the russians.""
in the early 18th century, the lezhgis formed two khanates, or sovereignties,
in what are now azerbaijan and dagestan. they roamed freely with their sheep
over the green hills and mountains between the two khanates.
by 1812, the lezghi areas were joined to czarist russia. after 1917, they
came under soviet rule. with the disintegration of the soviet union, the
600,000 lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders.
about half remained in dagestan and half in newly independent azerbaijan.
""we have to pay customs on all this, on cars, on wine,"" complained mais
talibov, a small trader. his goods, laid out on the ground at the bazaar,
included brandy, stomach medication and plastic shoes from dagestan.
""we want our own country,"" he said. ""we want to be able to move about easily.
but baku won't listen to us.""
physically, it is hard for outsiders to distinguish lezhgis from other
azerbaijanis. in many villages, they live side by side, working at the same
jobs and intermarrying to some degree.
but the lezhgis have a distinctive language, a mixture of arabic, turkish and
persian with strong guttural vowels.
azerbaijan officially supports the cultural preservation of its 10 largest
ethnic minorities. the lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary
school classes in their language.
autonomy is a different question. if the lezghis succeeded in separating from
azerbaijan, they would set a precedent for other minorities, such as the
talish in the south, the tats in the nearby mountains and the avars of eastern
azerbaijan.

consider newman v. schiff, 778 f.2d 460 (8th cir.1985), which i've seen
cited by tax protestors other than mr. teel as a win for mr. schiff.
mr. schiff offered 100,000 on tv to anyone who would call in the
show and cite any section of the internal revenue code that says that
an individual has to file a return.
mr. newman took him up on it. mr. newman had seen the show in a rebroadcast
the next morning. mr. schiff claimed that the offer only extended to
people who actually say the original broadcast, and so there was no offer
for mr. newman to accept, and so no unilateral contract was formed, and
so mr. schiff did not have to pay 100,000.
mr. schiff was correct, and so won. so, yes, mr. schiff won against a
claim on the 100,000 reward. however, his win had nothing to do with
the tax code."

brett apparently has numbed himself into thinking that the deficit
declined. if you keep spending more than you earn, the deficit keeps
growing. if you keep borrowing at a lesser rate than you borrowed
previously, the deficit increases. you only decrease deficits when your
income exceeds spending and you use the difference to pay off debts.

176865.eml,talk.politics.misc,"undoubtedly. in fact, it is the fact that hospitals frequently compete
for physicians rather than for patients that (in part) complicates and
undermines a simplistic free-market analysis of the market for medical care.
once again, there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidney
dialysis. although price controls have promoted an expansion of services
to a much greater volume of patients, rd is still a profitable service.
otherwise, one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than the
vast expansion that has occurred.
can you spell ""loss leader?"" i knew you could. grocery stores do not
attempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of
it. in fact, your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader
for other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained.
but the evidence does not support this contention. rather, it appears that
price controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of
service and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide
comparable benefits. providers continue to profit from rd, they simply
make less on each treatment than they would have if the price had
risen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have.
there is no question that had price controls forced the price of rd
substantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday
predictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restriction
of service, lagging technological development, etc. likewise, it appears
that in the va and armed forces medical care systems, where providers
are government agencies, some of these negative impacts may occur.
(rd patients in the va system in spokane, for example, must travel to
seattle, 300 miles away, for treatment.)
the bottom line, however, is that this is an example of government
intervention (of a rather extreme sort) that appears to have had beneficial
results for both providers and consumers. claims that ""government
bureaucracy"" inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplace
should take such such cases into account.

176866.eml,talk.politics.misc,"well, the two nifty letters giving concrete proof that the
income tax is voluntary and giving specific procedures for
stopping withholding, et cetera have been out there for a
while now.
humbug. those letters don't provide ""concrete proof"" of anything at all
in the absence of any case law that demonstrates the method will actu-
ally work for ordinary people in everyday situations.
specifically, show us some case law in which the courts have ruled that
income tax is illegal and or that ordinary working types do not have to
pay income tax (and that they can legally avoid paying income tax with-
out declaring themselves to be churches or some such silliness). this
issue is sufficiently important that i think we have a right to expect
something squarely on point from the us supreme court (in the case of
federal tax) or a state's supreme court (for a state's income tax).
unless you can do that, i for one am unwilling to call your material
""concrete proof"".
there has been no refutation to date. have the nay-sayers
finally given up as defeated? sure would like to hear their
reasons for disbelief at this point.
refutation?? refutation of what? you haven't made a case yet. you've
posted plenty of claims, but you haven't given us any valid reason to
believe that any court in the us will agree with you. your claims seem
on the surface to deviate so radically from the legal mainstream that i
feel the burden of proof is still on you to show that your arguments
have any merit whatsoever. and the cases you've cited involve such
strange situations that i see no reason to assume that the rulings are
applicable to anyone else, or that they will ultimately stand on appeal
to the supreme court.
why can't you just cite us a case in which joe schmoe, a regular
employee earning regular wages from a regular company, refuses to pay
his income tax, gets hauled into court, is convicted of wilful tax eva-
sion, and then has his conviction overturned by the us supreme court
with a landmark 7-2 majority ruling that income tax is indeed totally
voluntary? what, you say? no such case exists? hmmm, i wonder why
not; why haven't you?
shall i conclude that the point has been received and the
opposition has forfeited the field?
with all due respect, you can conclude anything you want. i just hope,
for your own sake, that you don't conclude that anyone in a position of
authority in the united states or any legitimate or illegitimate polit-
ical subdivision thereof is going to agree with your conclusions.
for that matter, i confess i'm thoroughly confused as to why you would
be looking for court rulings in your favor anyway -- since i thought you
told us earlier that every court in the us has been in cahoots with big
banking interests since the 1938 ""admiralty jurisdiction"" coverup thing.
do you honestly expect us to believe that they'd go to all the trouble
to subvert the system, and yet would still promptly slink back into
their burrows in the face of anyone who knew enough to invoke the right
combination of magic spells and mystic mumbo-jumbo?
not only that, but why do you even care what the us courts say anyway?
didn't you tell us a while back that you've disavowed all attempts by us
officials to classify you as a ""14th amendment federal citizen""? when
the fbi comes to haul you away for tax evasion, why don't you just tell
them they're out of their jurisdiction and should go back to washington,
d.c., where they belong?
or maybe we should all just go back to mediaeval common law, which you
suggested would be better than all these statutes, codes, and the like.
if you want to renounce society's legal framework, fine; we can just
declare you an outlaw, ok?, and anyone who sees you driving on the roads
with no license plate on your car and no driver's license in your wallet
can just take you like a game animal and stew you for their supper (with
plenty of veggies and a pinch of salt, but without prejudice ucc 1-207).
sorry, everyone, it's getting late, and i'm sick and tired of all this
garbage. if i know what's good for me, i'll just clam up and stop try-
ing to refute this nonsense, and if anyone falls for it and winds up in
jail for tax evasion or what-not, it'll be on their own head.
needless to say, none of the above represents the opinions of my current
employer -- who, in any case, is a canadian and doesn't really need to
care too much about us tax law. i, on the other hand, am a ""14th amend-
ment federal citizen"", with a us passport to prove it, and plan to keep
on filing form 1040's for the foreseeable future (though i will probably
not owe any us income tax due to the foreign earned income exclusion
and or the foreign tax credit).

unless i am badly mistaken, rohit is suggesting that protecting boys

in which boys and girls are apart from members of the opposite sex

some sense). these same situations don't (necessarily) protect the
children from abuse by members of the same sex.
if we can understand that, it's not such a tremendous leap to suggest
that if we all think about it hard, someone may come up with a
practical solution (or even a partial solution) to some of the situations
in which children are made vulnerable to homosexuals who wish to abuse
them. by working together ""with good will on both sides"", we may be

176901.eml,talk.politics.misc,"and of course, in states like kentucky and virginia, not well-suited to
large-scale plantations, slave labor was used to make one of the most
valuable agricultural products of all: more slaves. in some ways, this
treatment of humans beings as breeding livestock is the most horrifying
aspect of american slavery. second, although mechanization of cotton production could be expected to reduce the demands for labor eventually, it was only in the 1940's the mechanization of cotton production in the south largely eliminated the labor intensive character of the operation, long after the ""first mechanical cotton reaper"" was invented.
this is an interesting question. steinbeck's grapes of wrath (published in the 1930s), uses agricultural mechanization of cotton
production in arkansas as the cause of the joad family being evicted
from the land. how many years were involved in the mechanization of
cotton farming? when did this first appear? ken mitchell the powers not delegated to the united states by the steve hendricks domain: clayton e. cramer uunet,pyramid !optilink!cramer my opinions, all mine!

176903.eml,talk.politics.misc,"capital and labor are one and the same in a slave economy. except that
capital doesn't reproduce quite as readily as slaves did.
slavery was a dying institution before the cotton gin, yes, but not
in 1850. it is true that cotton suffered from price depression in the 1840's - the period used to claim that slavery would not have lasted in the south. that is not the argument that i have heard. it would not have lasted because the growth in the north would not have been sustained for much longer without spilling over to the southern states, i.e. northern industry would have migrated capital to the southern states, and with that would have come immigrant labor to the ports of the south, e.g. charleston, savannah, mobile, new orleans, etc. this would have put the breaks on the slave market and slavery would have been out-moded by the capital intensity of competing agriculturalists. those that insisted on keeping slaves because of their ""cruel hearts and hatred for black people"" would have been driven out of business. simple capital to labor ratio...read michael parkin microeconomics 2nd edition, and any other basic economics book.
this assumes that the slave holder dominance over state governments
would not have caused the passage of laws to keep out capital from the
north. since slave holders were prepared to do almost anything else
to destroy free markets in order to maintain slavery, i do not doubt
that they would have passed laws to cripple any serious competitive
threat. thomas sowell's market and minorities argues that the
maintenance of slavery, and the costs it imposed on state and local
governments, discouraged not only capital formation, but also outside
capital investment in the southern states. craig a. depken, ii

176910.eml,talk.politics.misc,"the word that is missing in this whole discourse is not the ""b""
word, or the ""h"" word, or even the ""n"" or ""w"" words. it is the ""l"" word -
loser !!
that's right. when we boil all the crap out of this argument, it
is all about winning and losing, and nothing else. let me explain.
remember the eighties ? no excuses. nobody who can handle a mail
buffer can claim they are ""too young"" to remember ronald reagan - yet.
the eighties were about ""how america learned to win once again"". then
(wouldn't you know), we won so well that there was nothing left to win.
no cold war to endure. no nuclear holocaust. no more worlds to conquer
(we forgot about outer space long ago). the kind of overwhelming, no
holds barred success that killed alexander the great. yes, there were a
few ""little"" problems along the way - stock market meltdown here, an
s l bailout there, a few revolts and crazy middle eastern dictators to
contend with, but as tacitus would tell ya', the god augustus never had
it so good.
in the meantime, there is guilt for winning, maybe a fear that one
doesn't deserve one's bounty - or success. so there is a ""kinder and gentler
type of politician these days, bill clinton, affirmative action, and lots of
discourse about people who ""don't get it"". for those of us in the winning
business, this kind of talk is mildly irritating, but there is still no
suggestion of losing.
but what do we find now ? to put it mildy, the stereotype of our
""white male"" non-winner is woody hayes in the rose bowl, punching out
photojournalists when those california fruits and nuts steal another one
with a ""hail mary"" pass in the fourth quarter. (the whole idea behind 'three
yards and a cloud of dust' is to wear your opponent down until he collapses
in the final period) but woody just used his fists - uzzies seem to be the
weapon of choice these days.
who is d-fens, anyway ? the answer is as plain as the horn rims on
your face. the guy is michael douglas, posing as a loser. this
is known as controversial casting. but that baggy short-sleeved white shirt
sure does look natural on mike doesn't it. gordon gekko will never look the
same. (though woody always dressed that way.) did we really expect gekko to
take it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ?
what we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing d-fens is
the same game as bashing that poor african american slug that clint eastwood
used to blow away all the time. as that arch-wasp (male gender) george c. scott
declaimed, ""americans traditionally love to win. they love a winner, and will
not tolerate a loser."" and so on.
the political implications are simple. if, as many socialists - and
democrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some
""equitable"" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a
loser to tell whose side you are on. that could be black women today, asian
homosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined
day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39 )
minority.
or you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do most
conservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn't care
who's winning and who's losing. in some cases, you might say something
about make sure the game is fair (equality of opportunity, not of condition).
in the latter case, you might be able to identify yourself as a
""neoconservative"" or a ""neoliberal"" depending on how much you want to limit
the pot.
either way you go, the way of the winner is no longer the way to be
popular - at least after you graduate from high school (but you'll still
be popular at high school reunions). but it beats being a nerd, as i
would imagine michael douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it
is the only way to go. (even in hollywood, which treats losers worse than any
other place in america except for new york and washington, d.c. - and even in
columbus, ohio, which produced alex keaton, but no champion football teams in
the eighties and the first quarter of the nineties) i'd like to
see more winners in this society, regardless of race, gender, religious
preference, and sexual orientation. maybe we should even let a few more of
them be white men !! (we should definitely let the buckeyes win the rose bowl
someday)

washington, dc -- the energy tax and subsidized energy-efficiency
measures supported by president clinton and energy secretary hazel
o'leary are based on faulty assumptions, a new study from the cato
institute points out.
according to jerry taylor, cato's director of natural resource studies,
we are not running out of sources of energy. the world now has almost 10
times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of
1970. proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as
dramatically.
when standards of living, population densities, and industrial
structures are controlled for, the united states is no less energy
efficient than japan and more energy efficient than many of the group
of seven nations.
energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil
price shocks because the energy economy is global. moreover, since the
cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,
even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the
overall u.s. economy.
market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per 1,000 of gnp than are centrally planned economies.
utilities' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side
management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource
inputs, an competitive inequities. furthermore, dsm programs do not
reduce demand.
taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes
unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that
subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance,
gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood
of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state
at the expense of the individual.
""energy conservation and efficiency: the case against coercion"" is no.

the cato institute
founded in 1977, the cato institute is a public policy research
foundation dedicated to broadening the parameters of policy debate
to allow consideration of more options that are consistent with the
traditional american principles of limited government, individual
liberty, and peace. to that end, the institute strives to achieve
greater involvement of the intelligent, concerned lay public in
questions of policy and the proper role of government.
the institute is named for cato's letters, libertarian pamphlets
that were widely read in the american colonies in the early 18th
century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation
of the american revolution.
despite the achievement of the nation's founders, today virtually
no aspect of life is free from government encroachment. a pervasive
intolerance for individual rights is shown by government's arbitrary
intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for
civil liberties.
to counter that trend the cato institute undertakes an extensive
publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy
issues. books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned
to examine the federal budget, social security, regulation, military
spending, international trade, and myriad other issues. major policy
conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are
published thrice yearly in the cato journal.
in order to maintain its independence, the cato institute accepts
no government funding. contributions are received from foundations,
corporations, and individuals, and other revenue is generated from
the sale of publications. the institute is a nonprofit, tax-exempt,

this is the dr. beter audio letter(r), 1629 k st. nw, washington,
dc 20006.
hello, my friends, this is dr. beter. today is april 30,
1982, and this is my audio letter(r) no. 74.
it's now been almost one month since war broke out in the south
atlantic. on the surface it seems that it's only a dispute
between argentina and great britain over the barren, wind-swept
falkland islands and south georgia island. in reality, it's far
more than that.
the so-called falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a
giant military operation. during this month of april 1982,
fierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the south
atlantic but also in the south pacific. up to now most of the
hostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on
all sides. but as i say these words, the naval war in the
southern hemisphere is about to come to the surface.
beginning today, april 30, a total naval and air blockade of
the falklands by the royal navy has begun. at the same time a
counterblockade has been declared by argentina in the same area.
to be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of
time, but the royal navy does not have that much time. winter is
coming on in the south atlantic, and the british supply lines are
overextended. having come this far, her majesty's navy cannot
simply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time
without drawing blood from argentina. as a result the british
will be forced to undertake military operations very soon no
matter how risky they may be.
there is also another reason why the royal navy now has no
choice but to engage the argentine forces in combat. that
reason, my friends, is that the royal navy has already suffered
losses in secret combat this month. up to this moment there will
be no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by
the british fleet. only when publicly admitted fighting erupts
will the british dare to admit that they have suffered battle
losses. to obtain that cover story, the british have no choice
but to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking
even heavier losses on top of those already sustained. in short,
my friends, her majesty's navy has sailed into a trap.
the events now unfolding in the south atlantic carry strange,
ironic echoes of the past. for weeks now we've been hearing
countless commentators referring to the british task force as an
""armada"" (quote). the british of all people ought to be very
uneasy with that description. the original spanish armada 400
years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force,
but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it
changed the course of history--and it was none other than the
english navy that destroyed the spanish armada.
the original spanish armada put to sea in 1588 during the
reign of england's queen elizabeth i. the armada was an invasion
fleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade england.
they were met by the daring sea dogs of sir francis drake. drake
and his small, fast ships turned the tables on the spanish armada
by changing the rules of battle. the english fleet was equipped
with new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of
reach. from there the english pounded, smashed, and shattered
the big ships of the mighty armada. when it was all over, barely
half the spanish fleet was left to limp back to port. drake's
defeat of the spanish armada was a shock to the world. it opened
the door for england under queen elizabeth i to start its
expansion into a truly global empire.
today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full
circle. queen elizabeth ii is witnessing the dismantling of the
world empire whose heyday began under queen elizabeth i, and now
the cultures of england and of spain are once again in
confrontation. once again a so-called armada is preparing for
invasion, but this time the armada is british, not spanish. four
hundred years ago sir francis drake was the hero of the day;
today, the ghost of francis drake is once again on the scene.
the south atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the drake
passage around the southern tip of south america. the defeat of
the spanish armada four centuries ago broke the back of spain's
naval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new british armada may
well break the back of what remains of the once glorious royal
navy.
my three special topics for this audio letter are:
topic 1--the military secret of south georgia island
topic 2--the secret naval war of the southern hemisphere
topic 3--the rockefeller fear campaign against nuclear war.
topic 1--when the falkland islands crisis began early this month
it looked at first like a tempest in a teapot. for a century and
a half since 1833, the islands have been controlled by great
britain. during that entire time, british sovereignty over the
falklands has been disputed by argentina. there have been
countless threats by argentina to seize the islands, which it
calls the malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing
in the past and britain has never even gotten very worried about
them.
the islands are four times as distant from argentina as cuba
is from the united states, and they are not much of a prize.
after 150 years of occupancy, the falklands are home to fewer
than 2,000 british settlers and a lot of sheep. in short, the
remote falkland islands hardly look like something to fight over,
and yet here we are watching another crisis take place. we are
watching as war erupts between great britain and argentina.
the thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all
about its usual preoccupation with the soviet threat at nato's
doorstep. instead, britain is throwing almost everything it's
got at argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers,
submarines, assault ships--you name it. luxury cruise ships have
even been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight.
wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated
and sent to join the fleet even after it sailed. ships and
submarines have been pulled off station from normal nato duty and
sent to reinforce the task force. the initial 40-ship force has
grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada
numbering over 70. over two-thirds of the entire royal navy has
already been deployed to the south atlantic off argentina.
watching all this, a lot of people are asking: what's this
fight really all about? the most popular answer suggested in the
major media is ""oil."" vast deposits of oil are known to exist
under the continental shelf between argentina and the falklands,
but that has been known for nearly 10 years. in no way does it
explain the timing of the sudden military offensive by argentina
this month, and oil explains even less about the argentine
seizure of south georgia island.
south georgia island is 800 miles east of the falklands with
no known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to south
georgia, the falklands are an island paradise. south georgia
island is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys,
glaciers, and semi-permanent snow. most of it is uninhabitable.
on top of all that, argentina has absolutely no legal or
historical claim to south georgia island. in that respect it
stands in sharp contrast to the falklands.
in the early 1830s the falklands were occupied for a while by
argentine colonists. in 1833 the british expelled them and took
over the island. for that and other historical reasons,
argentina argues that the falklands really belong to argentina,
not britain.
but no such argument is possible for south georgia island. it
has always been controlled by britain, never by argentina or
spain. the argentine seizure of south georgia island looks even
more unreasonable from a military point of view. argentina's
leaders are military men and they think in military terms. they
were well aware ahead of time that far-off south georgia island
could not possibly be held for long. by seizing it they were
setting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the island
was retaken by britain. so the question is: why did argentina's
military junta bother with the seemingly worthless south georgia
island at all?
my friends, the answers to all these questions are military,
not political or economic. south georgia island possesses an
enormous military secret. it's a giant underground installation
buried under the mountains at the northwest end of the island.
the real reason for the so-called falkland crisis is this secret
installation, together with two other similar installations which
i will describe shortly.
the secret military complexes have been in existence for many
years; they are not new. what is new is the accelerated nuclear
war timetable of the american bolshevik war planners here in
washington. for the past two months i've been reporting the
details of this new war plan to you as quickly as i can obtain
and verify them.
the plan calls for nuclear war one to erupt by september of
this year 1982!! it is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat
that caused the so-called falklands crisis to erupt now.
what is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of
the bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war. the
mutual enemies of the american bolsheviks here--namely, the
rockefeller cartel--and russia's new rulers in the kremlin are
behind the present crisis. they are trying to ruin phase 3 of
the ""project z"" war plan which i revealed last month. that phase
is to be world domination by the american bolsheviks after both
russia and the united states have been destroyed in nuclear war
one. as i mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the
existence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around
the world.
the american bolshevik military planners here in america are
working with other bolshevik agents in key military positions of
other countries to set off war. having done that, they intend to
ride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in
government war bunkers! when the warring nations finally lie
smoldering and exhausted, the bolsheviks will leave the shattered
remains of their host countries. they will rendezvous at the
secret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the
open. they will confront the world with the only remaining
fresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using
that military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of
the world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to
pave the way for world domination very soon by setting off
nuclear war one in a matter of months. the rockefeller cartel
and russia's new anti-bolshevik rulers are working together in a
race against time to try to head off the bolshevik war plan.
last month i mentioned that the bolsheviks here are
benefitting from war preparations which were started by the
rockefellers long ago. it has only been about three years since
the rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the united
states government by the bolsheviks. since that time the united
states government has been a house divided, torn by internal
power struggles between rival bolshevik and rockefeller factions.
but before that, the united states had been dominated for decades
both economically and politically by the four rockefeller
brothers.
in 1961 the brothers launched a new long-range plan for world
domination. it was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half
secret, which i first described long ago in audio letter no. 28.
it was a plan for the united states to arm to the teeth in secret
while appearing to disarm gradually. without repeating all the
details, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple. by
deliberately appearing weak, the rockefeller-controlled united
states would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with russia.
then the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be
unleashed to smash russia and take over the world.
when they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the
rockefeller brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the
late 1970s. their military analysts concluded very early that
the war being planned would have very different effects on the
northern and southern hemispheres. both superpowers, the united
states and the soviet union, are located well up in the northern
hemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--great
britain, france, red china, and india. by contrast, the
strategic targets for nuclear war in the southern hemisphere are
relatively few and far between. in other words, it was expected
that the coming nuclear war would be essentially a northern
hemisphere war.
in an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious
radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas
not initially hit by war. but there are limits to how far the
war clouds can spread. it was discovered long ago that there is
very little mixing between the air of the northern and southern
hemispheres. in the northern half of our planet, cold air from
the north pole works its way southward towards the equator, then
it works its way back to the north as warm air. a mirror image
of this process takes up the southern half of the planet.
northern and southern hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone,
but very little of the air changes places.
the military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming
nuclear war could ruin large areas of the northern hemisphere for
generations to come; but if the calculations are right, the
southern hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war.
this was music to the ears of the four rockefeller brothers. a
quick look at the globe of the world shows why. the rockefeller
cartel has dominated latin america ever since world war ii. as i
discussed in my very first monthly audio letter, nelson
rockefeller solidified the cartel grip on latin america during
the war. he accomplished this as so-called ""coordinator of
hemispheric defense"" for then-president franklin d. roosevelt.
so that takes care of the south american continent and its
natural resources.
then there is the african continent. there, too, rockefeller
control was already in effect over wide areas of black africa,
especially south of the equator. all this was thanks to the
efforts of john d. rockefeller iii, as i detailed in audio letter
no. 36.
looking around the globe, the most important remaining land
masses from the standpoint of world domination are australia and
new zealand. thanks to world war ii, both were wide open to the
rockefellers.
the rockefeller brothers decided to establish secret military
installations in the southern hemisphere for use after the coming
war. by this means they expected to become the masters of the
surviving southern half of planet earth after the northern
hemisphere war. then, as the northern hemisphere gradually
recovered from the nuclear holocaust, the rockefeller empire
would be able to pick up the pieces. in this way the third
generation rockefeller brothers expected their family dynasty to
inherit the earth.
in order to control the southern hemisphere militarily after
the war, some means would have to be available to project
military power onto any land mass. for example, revolts against
rockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the
beam weapons on the moon. the most critical factor for postwar
military domination of the world was found to be a navy. a
minimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based
in the south atlantic, the other in the south pacific. since the
reserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the
northern hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in
existing shipyards. new construction facilities had to be built
and they had to be hidden. to hide an entire shipyard is no
small task; they take up a lot of space. on top of that, it was
essential that the ships remain hidden after they were built.
the best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and
naval base into one over-all secret installation. finally, the
secret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear
attack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered
prematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.
the combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection
against attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all
these plans were still in the early stages of development, the
answer presented itself. during a so-called banking trip to
sweden, david rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden
naval port. the port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs
which come right down to the water. the entrance to the port is
a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off
with enormous steel doors. inside this big doorway on the water
a huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.
the rockefeller brothers and their military adviser decided
that a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the
swedish hidden port was just what they wanted. a survey of
candidate sites was then initiated. the site survey covered
coastal areas throughout the southern hemisphere. many areas
were rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong.
other areas were rejected because they were too close to the
equator. still others had to be ruled out because there were too
many people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy
impossible. finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for
the secret naval installations be totally secure politically.
at last the sites for the secret naval installations were
selected. in the south pacific, extreme southern new zealand was
selected. this is what i was alluding to in audio letter no. 71
three months ago when i called attention to new zealand's extreme
importance in the coming war.
in order to obtain the necessary space, the secret new zealand
naval installation had to be divided up into two sites located
close together. one is at the extreme southwest tip of south
island where the mountain range known as the southern alps comes
down virtually to the water's edge. the other part of the
installation is built into the northwest tip of stewart island,
which is off the tip of south island. the stewart island
facility is hollowed out within a rise known as mt. anglem.
the new zealand location met all the requirements. ever since
world war ii the government of new zealand has been tied even
closer to the united states than to great britain. the location
is far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep
under mountains, protected from nuclear attack. they are also
too deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the new
zealand site is well situated to command the entire south
pacific.
in the south atlantic an even more perfect site was found.
that site, my friends, is south georgia island. it is located
perfectly for naval domination of the entire south atlantic. the
tall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret
installation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island.
it is controlled by great britain whose government, like that of
new zealand, was willing to cooperate; and south georgia island
was virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the
northeast coast. the whaling station was some 50 miles away from
the secret new installation which was being built, but britain
took no chances. in 1965 the whaling station was closed down.
since that time there have been no inhabitants on south georgia
island except for a few dozen alleged antarctic scientists.
construction of the secret naval facilities--two in new
zealand, one on south georgia island--began in the early 1960's.
the techniques were adapted from those used previously to build
other large underground facilities, such as the norad
installation inside cheyenne mountain, colorado; however these
techniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve
construction access directly from the sea instead of overland.
in this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in
appearance both during and after construction.
the cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let
ships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well
camouflaged. like the swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the
entrances to the secret installations can be sealed up. when
sealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you
know exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction
projects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying
around to attract attention. the man-made caverns which house
the secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and
debris was disposed of at sea.
once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be
outfitted for ship construction and docksite storage. the fake
disarmament of the united states during the 1960s contributed
greatly to this task. from 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal
role in this elaborate rockefeller scheme. he was then-secretary
of defense robert mcnamara. all through the 60's mcnamara
presided over the public paring back of america's visible
military power. this included the closing down and dismantling
of entire shipyards. what we were not told was where all that
shipyard equipment went afterwards. where it went, my friends,
was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in
new zealand and south georgia island!
the secret naval installations have been used as duplication
facilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and
built here in the united states. as defense secretary caspar
weinberger told congress recently, it is cheaper to build two
ships at a time. that is especially true if the second ship is
an exact duplicate of the first. this has become even more true
in recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing
techniques.
the secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret
installations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of
certain other ships and submarines. they are all nuclear
powered--nuclear ""subs""; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers;
and yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them. a secret twin
was built for the u.s.s. nimitz, for the u.s.s. eisenhower, and
for the newly-launched u.s.s. carl vincent. all have been
financed through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we
constantly hear about in the defense department; and all three
carriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft
whose manufacture was financed the same way!
the ships of the secret american bolshevik naval fleets are
all duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels. even so, the
secret naval ships possess one key difference.
last month i revealed that the so-called ""stealth program"" has
succeeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility
shield. this technique makes an object invisible from a distance
by distorting light waves in its vicinity.
a whole new fleet of phantom war-planes are now going into
crash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of
the secret american bolshevik navy ships have already been
outfitted with similar stealth-field equipment! the stealth
principle is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes
because there is more room for the powerful equipment that
generates the field.
after nuclear war one, the secret stealth navy of the american
bolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on
earth. it would be perfect for the intended role of world
domination. the rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my
friends, but three years ago they lost control of the united
states military. now it's the american bolsheviks who are in
control, and they are bent on war.
these secret naval installations have precipitated what is
being called the ""falklands crisis.""
topic 2--in audio letter(r) no. 73 last month i described
""project z"", the new bolshevik three-phase strategy for nuclear
war one.
an elite group of american bolshevik military planners here
are flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in
washington. it's a plan by which the united states will strike
the first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war
with russia.
having set off the holocaust, the bolsheviks here and in
certain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable
war bunkers. finally after nuclear war one fizzles out in
stalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the united
states and her allies. activating phase 3 of their grand
strategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially
their secret naval fleets. with these they plan to conquer and
rule what is left of the world. the united states as we know it
will be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the bolsheviks
themselves, this outcome will constitute victory.
up to now the nuclear war timetable which i first revealed two
months ago is still on track. they are still shooting for
nuclear war to begin by september of this year 1982! time is
fast running out.
the bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward
war; but, my friends, the bolsheviks are not the only runners in
this race. they have two deadly enemies, both of whom are
equally determined to trip up the bolsheviks. one enemy of the
bolsheviks here is the rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the
new anti-bolshevik ruling clique in russia; and now these two
mutual enemies of the bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in
certain ways.
in audio letter no. 71 three months ago i reported that a
limited, new anti-bolshevik coalition was in the works between
the rockefeller cartel and the russians. the january 26 meeting
between haig and gromyko in geneva, switzerland, was a turning
point in the formation of this coalition. it is now a reality,
and is responsible for the so-called ""falkland crisis"" now
dominating the headlines. it should be emphasized that this new
relationship between the rockefeller cartel and russia falls far
short of a true alliance. they have very major disputes to be
settled between them, but for the time being they have called a
truce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly
enemy--the bolsheviks here in america.
the first priority of the russians and the rockefellers is to
slow down the bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war.
if they can do that, time is on the side of the rockefeller
cartel in certain political movements which i discussed last
summer in audio letter no. 67. a slow-down in the nuclear war
timetable will also give more breathing space for additional
anti-bolshevik actions to be implemented.
the joint rockefeller-russian planners decided by mid-february
that military action against the bolsheviks was essential very
quickly. no other type of action had any hope of taking effect
fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.
the exact details of the ""project z"" war plan are not known to
either the rockefellers or the russians, but the general outlines
are known to be as i described last month.
it was decided that military action should be devised that
would undermine phase 3 of the bolshevik war plan--that is, the
bolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the
southern hemisphere should be attacked and crippled. by working
together, the rockefeller cartel and the russians were able to
devise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone.
the rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these
bases, provided detailed intelligence about the best way to
attack them. the russians with their enormous military machine
provided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.
it was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both
secret fleets in the south atlantic and south pacific to be
attacked. survival intact of either fleet would leave the
bolshevik war plan still workable.
military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault
on the new zealand facilities was out of the question. there was
no combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force
which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside
world. any attack on the new zealand bases would set off the
very war which the rockefellers and russians want to prevent.
but the situation in the south atlantic was a different
matter. in a way, the greatest asset of south georgia island was
also its achilles' heel. the extreme isolation which protected
the secrecy of the south georgia base also made a covert military
assault feasible. the key lay with argentina and her
long-standing claims to the falkland islands.
as i mentioned in topic 1, the rockefeller cartel has
dominated all of latin america for decades. cartel operatives
were sent to argentina to work out a deal with the government
military junta there. the historic dispute over the falkland
islands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to
enable the south georgia base to be attacked. the argentine
generals were not told everything about the situation by any
means, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to
do.
as an inducement to cooperate, the argentine leaders were
promised handsome rewards. they were guaranteed that after the
shooting was over, the falkland islands would remain in argentine
hands. this guarantee included the promise of covert military
assistance as needed against the royal navy. and to bolster the
troubled argentine economy, it was promised that the rockefeller
cartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves. with
these combined promises of military glory and financial rewards,
the argentine military junta agreed to the plan.
on march 19 argentina carried out act 1 in the joint attack
plan. a group of argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things,
landed at the abandoned old whaling station on south georgia
island. supposedly they were there to dismantle the old
buildings and cart them off to sell. while they were at it they
also raised the argentine flag over the work-site. the british,
always nervous about south georgia island, promptly reacted as
expected. the british antarctic survey ship ""endurance"" put 22
marines ashore. they drove off the scrap merchants and tore down
the argentine flag.
the incident provided the desired excuse for the argentine
junta to bring the simmering 150-year-old falklands dispute to a
boil. from time to time in the past, argentina has claimed that
south georgia is part of the falklands because it is administered
that way by britain. that argument is very flimsy but it now
came in very handy. it was nothing new to hear this from
argentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.
during late march, argentine military forces started
assembling for an assault on the falklands. ""nothing new"",
thought the british high command. argentina has carried out
threatening maneuvers in the past many times. it was believed
that they were about to do it again; but on april 2 argentine
forces did the unexpected. after many past false alarms, this
time they actually invaded and seized the islands. all argentine
public statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims
to the falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next
day a small argentine force also seized far-off south georgia
island. the force was so small that it gave the appearance
initially that it was just a side show from argentina's point of
view; however, the small contingent of 22 royal marines were
overpowered and bundled off the island along with a group of 13
alleged scientists. that was the moment of payoff in the joint
rockefeller-russian attack plan.
thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the argentine
forces, a special commando team got onto the island undetected.
based on the detailed rockefeller information about the base, the
team moved to a location on the mountain directly above the
cavernous secret base. special high-speed drilling equipment was
set up by the rockefeller members of the team while the russian
members concentrated on military defense. by late that evening,
april 3, the military high command in london finally learned what
was really taking place. the secret south georgia base was under
attack by virtually the only means possible. the joint
rockefeller-russian team were drilling a shaft down through the
mountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside. it was only a
matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling
of the giant hidden naval base. once the hole was made, the next
step was obvious. the rockefeller-russian team would put a
weapon of some kind through the hole. the best guess was that it
would be a nerve gas.
the shock waves that went through the highest levels of the
british government on the evening of april 3 can hardly be
described, my friends. the thatcher government, like the
so-called reagan administration here in america, is bolshevik
controlled. that's why margaret thatcher always says, ""me, too""
any time the reagan administration says or does anything against
russia. both governments are party to the secret nuclear war
plan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective
countries, and on the evening of april 3 they suddenly discovered
that their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.
immediately the thatcher government started assembling a naval
armada to sail for the south atlantic. haste was the order of
the day. the drilling on south georgia island was proceeding
around the clock. the best estimates were that the drilling
would break through into the roof of the naval base in about
three weeks, on or about april 24. if help did not reach south
georgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed. the
forces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend
themselves under the circumstances. their mighty naval ships
were ships in a bottle. they did not dare open the bottle to
sail out to fight because the russian commandos were armed with
tactical and nuclear weapons. to open the blast-proof entrance
doors would be suicide.
on april 5, just two days after south georgia island was
seized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of british ports.
the same day lord carrington was sacked as foreign minister. he
was forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the
rockefeller attack plan by downplaying the argentine attack
preparations.
that same day, april 5, new zealand, the home of the other
secret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with argentina.
the two hidden new zealand facilities had been placed on ""red
alert."" as a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin
base were ordered to sea. several surface ships were already at
sea undergoing ""sea trials"", but that still left seven (7) major
ships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the
nuclear aircraft carriers i mentioned earlier.
on that busy day of april 5, argentina's foreign minister,
costa mendez, was at the united nations in new york. he was
alarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the royal navy.
costa mendez hurried here to washington to seek reassurances from
certain officials. he got them!
for the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories
about the allegedly slow movement of the british fleet while
negotiations went on. that, my friends, was only a cover story.
the royal navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as
possible toward south georgia island. if the task force arrived
in time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely. the
official stories about ""slow movement"" of the british armada were
intended to give a cushion of time for that battle. if need be,
the fleet would have several days to retake south georgia island,
then it could move on to arrive near the falklands on the
announced schedule. in this way the crucial importance of south
georgia island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.
it was initially expected that advance elements of the british
fleet would reach the vicinity of south georgia island within two
weeks. that would have been soon enough to attack the joint
rockefeller-russian commando team and stop the drilling before it
was completed. but russian cosmospheres and submarines made a
shambles of the plan.
key advance elements of the south georgia attack contingent
left ascension island early april 14, two days before it was
announced officially. shortly after they did so, they ran into
trouble. russian cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on
a single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on
south georgia island. the cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and
combat information center of the ship with neutron radiation. in
moments the ship was without any command, its communications and
radar silenced. then a russian ""sub"" closed in and quickly
finished off this key british ship with torpedoes. it broke
apart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly. so far as is
known, there were no survivors.
this unexpected shock in the mid-atlantic produced two
results, both important:
first, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the south atlantic
by the british armada. the task force had to be regrouped into a
configuration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost
valuable time. public announcements from london about the
progress of the fleet reflected this slowdown. the timetable for
arrival on battle stations near the falklands started stretching
out longer and longer. all this bought extra time for the joint
commando team on south georgia island. the drilling continued.
the other result of the sinking was equally important. word was
flashed to the south pacific stealth navy to prepare for possible
action. it was obvious that the russian navy was getting
involved in the atlantic, which meant that the royal navy could
be in big trouble. during the dead of night, early april 15, the
seven stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in
southern new zealand. they deployed to a secret operational
headquarters area in the antipodes islands, 450 miles southeast
of new zealand. their electromagnetic shields were operating to
provide protection from attack. these shields make it impossible
to communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as i
explained last month; but once they arrived at the antipodes, the
stealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded
communication cables to the island headquarters. the antipodes
headquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the south
georgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of
south america. the deployment of the available ships of the
south pacific stealth fleet was exactly what the joint
rockefeller-russian planners had hoped for. the ships had been
flushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in
new zealand!
the british ship's sinking of april 14 was also followed by
other events. on april 15 the argentine navy started moving out
of port. the same day, alexander haig arrived again in buenos
aires. supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he
was there as a general, dealing with generals. haig is the top
governmental operative of the rockefeller cartel, as i have
revealed in the past. he was making sure that the argentines did
not get cold feet and back down at that critical moment. four
days later, april 19, haig left for washington. as he boarded
his plane, haig somberly told reporters, ""time is running out.""
and so it was, my friends, for the secret south georgia base.
the very next day, april 20, the drill broke through into the
hollowed-out cavern of the naval base. bolshevik military
analysts in london had not expected that it could be completed
until at least the following weekend. the british fleet was
still out of range.
the weapon which the commando team inserted down through the
long hole was a small, compact russian neutron bomb. when it was
detonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the
effects were devastating. the intense radiation instantly killed
everyone inside the base. also the heat and blast effects of the
bomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside
sufficiently to badly disable them.
meanwhile, russian cosmospheres and submarines were converging
on the stealth ships which were near the antipodes islands
awaiting orders. from a distance, the ships were invisible to
the eye due to their protective shields, which also protect
against beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the
tactics which the russians employed.
floating overhead, the cosmospheres located the seven ships
using their psychoenergetic range-finding equipment known as prf.
as i have reported in the past, there is no method known by which
prf can be jammed. the cosmospheres radioed the exact locations
of the ships to the attack submarines. the ""subs"" were armed
with special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to
explode on impact. more sophisticated torpedoes would have been
thrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective
shield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right
through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode.
within 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven bolshevik
stealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went
their bolshevik commanders and mercenary crews collected from
around the world.
the south pacific action took place just after sunset local
time. the time here in washington was around 2:00 p.m. april 23.
that evening secretary of state haig was seen briefly in public
with the new british foreign minister, francis pym. pym was
wearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught
always to display in public. but not haig. haig was grinning
from ear to ear, and no wonder. the joint rockefeller-russian
military operation had been a brilliant success. the secret
bolshevik south atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out,
bottled up inside south georgia island; and the south pacific
fleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled. by
working together, the rockefeller cartel and the russians had won
the secret naval war of the southern hemisphere.
topic 3--as i say these words, news reports give the impression
that war is about to erupt in the south atlantic, but the real
war in the southern hemisphere is already over. what we are
watching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath. that
aftermath is the battle for the falkland islands. they have been
promised to argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.
at this moment the bolsheviks here in washington are pressing
for a public announcement that the united states will side with
britain. as soon as that takes place, military action will heat
up fast around the falklands. britain has no choice but to
fight. she has already suffered casualties which cannot be
explained without a public battle; but by fighting, the
bolsheviks in britain are running the risk of a humiliating and
tragic defeat for the royal navy.
meanwhile, the rockefeller strategists here are now
concentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign. on
all sides now we are hearing about the so-called ""nuclear freeze
movement."" there are documentaries, articles, publicity of all
kinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war. in recent
months, there have even been referenda popping up on election
ballots dealing with the nuclear war issue. medical doctors are
banding together to warn the public about what would happen if
there were a nuclear war.
we are being told that all this is just popping up
spontaneously. we are now 37 years into the nuclear age and
nothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet
now we are supposed to believe that millions of americans have
spontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time. if you
believe that, my friends, i give up. movements like this never,
and i mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and
money--and plenty of it.
what we are watching is the rockefeller public relations
machine at work. as i've explained in the past, the rockefeller
cartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place. if it
does, they will lose everything because they are not in a
position to control it. instead, the deadly enemies of the
rockefeller cartel, the bolsheviks here, will win out if there is
a war; and so the rockefeller faction is now doing everything in
its power to prevent a nuclear war.
the present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the rockefeller
cartel creates certain temporary common interests between them
and russia; but as russia's new rulers know very well, this does
not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the
rockefeller group. it's purely a matter of practical necessity
right now for the rockefellers.
the russians regard the united states as a house divided, and
they are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with
the rockefellers. their first priority is to rid the world of
the deadly bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear
war; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of
reckoning with the rockefeller cartel some day.
the rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective
with their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda. that objective is
renewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old
dream of world government. the bolsheviks here have unwittingly
provided fertile ground for the powerful new rockefeller antiwar
campaign. under bolshevik control, the so-called reagan
administration has become so hawkish that it's scaring people.
the rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on
that latent fear as a tool of power.
these days the smell of war is in the air. the falklands
crisis is helping to make that more intense. the rockefeller
propaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that
surrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war. a new
super-united nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the
bill. it will have teeth! as presently envisioned, the new
organization will be based in geneva, switzerland. the working
name, though this may be changed, is the ""world nonproliferation
council."" the plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of
nuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be
to use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.
last minute summary
now it's time for my last minute summary. in this audio
letter i have reported on the reasons behind the so-called
falkland islands crisis. the crisis erupted because of secret
bolshevik-controlled naval installations in the southern
hemisphere. these have been attacked by joint action of the
rockefeller cartel and the russians in an attempt to slow down
the nuclear-war timetable. the attacks were successful, but the
results remain to be seen. one result, though, is that the royal
navy has now been drawn into a trap. britain's waterloo at sea
may well be at hand.
my friends, two factions are struggling for control over our
united states--the rockefeller cartel and the bolsheviks. they
differ in style but both seek to control us through fear. if we
are ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the
power of our lord jesus christ, our only hope. as the scripture
tells us, our lord ""...has not given us the spirit of fear; but
of power, of love, and of a sound mind."" we must learn to wage
peace. as our lord declared long ago, ""blessed are the
peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of god.""
until next month, god willing, this is dr. beter. thank you,
and may god bless each and every one of you."

press conference by the president
with russian press
canada place
vancouver, british columbia
2:46 p.m. pdt
q i had two questions for both presidents, so you
could probably answer for boris, too. (laughter.)
the president: i'll give you my answer, then i'll
give you yeltsin's answer. (laughter.)
q the first is that this is the meeting of the
presidents, so the money that's being promised is government
money, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the
government. but you've indicated that three-quarters are going
to be going to businesses. so the question is how the russian
businesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever? what
are the priorities, because there are several association of
russian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to
participate in setting up priorities for investment?
this is the first. and second, to you. we know
that polls, public polls in america do not show that americans
are very enthusiastic about giving this aid. like newsweek polls
say that about 75 percent don't approve it, and new york times
published that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war;
42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent
if it just personally supports yeltsin. how are you going to
sort of handle this problem that americans themselves are not
very enthusiastic? thank you.
q i have a question, i'm sorry -- is there going
to be a translation of everything into russian? no, just the
answers. just the answers. okay.
the president: the answer to the first question is,
it depends on what kind of aid we're discussing. for example,
the funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will
obviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be
good risks and make the application. the privatization fund will
be used to support the privatization of existing public
enterprises. then there are some other general funds in the
democracy corps and other things which people in russia will have
some influence over the distribution of.
with regard to your second question, let me say that
i would think that there would be people in both countries who
would not feel too warmly toward simply the american government
giving money to the russian government. there's opposition to
that in russia. and in our country, throughout our whole history
there has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds. that
is, this has nothing to do with russia. if you look at the whole
history of america, any kind of aid program has always been
unpopular.
what i have tried to tell the american people is, is
this is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that
this is an investment in our future. we spent 4 trillion --
trillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments
because of the cold war. now, with a democratic government in
russia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them
working on a democracy and struggling to get their economies
going, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it
possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the
economy of russia to grow because of the potential for trade and
investment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce
nuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on
our side and on the russian side.
so i don't see this as an aid program; this is an
investment for the united states. this is very much in the
interest of the united states. the things i announced today, the
second stage of the program, which i hope to put together next
week, in my view are things that are good for my country and for
the taxpayers and workers of my country.
russia is a very great nation that needs some
partnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share
her goals. but it would be a great mistake for anyone to view
this as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue. that's not
what it is, it's an investment for america and it's a wonderful
investment.
like all investments, there is some risk. but
there's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than
the 4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier
of the cold war.
q mr. president, first of all thank you very
much, indeed, for coming here and talking to us. in the memory
of the living correspondents, this is the first time an american
president is doing this to the russian press corps, so it's kind
of a very measured breakthrough.
i have two questions. one, in your introductory
remarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief
that you discussed the start ii and start i issues. could you
tell us: did you reach an agreement with president yeltsin as to
what might be done in order to have ukraine join the ratification
of start i and the npt regime? and my second question is, how
confident you are that the united states congress would be eager
to support you in lifting jackson-vanik and other restrictions
inherited from the cold war?
president clinton: first, we discussed the issue of
ukraine with regard to start i and npt, and generally, with
regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent
states all be non-nuclear; but also to have the united states
develop strong relationships with them. we know that one thing
that we could do that would increase, i think, the willingness of
the ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude
our own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that
would provide not only an important economic opportunity for
russia, but also for ukraine, and it would show some reaching out
on our part. but we agreed that basically the people who signed
off on the lisbon protocol have got to honor what they did, and
we agreed to continue to press that.
i, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to
reassure ukraine's leaders, specifically the president and the
foreign minister, that i want strong ties with ukraine, that the
united states very much wants a good relationship with ukraine,
but that, in order to do what we need to do together to
strengthen the economy of ukraine and to have the united states
be fully supportive, the commitment to ratify start i and to join
the npt regime is critical.
what was the second question?
the president: with regard to jackson-vanik and
cocom, i would make two points: first, i have agreed with the
republican and democratic leaders in the congress that we will,
as soon as i return, have a list of all the legislative and other
restrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on
relations between the united states and russia, that are legacies
of the cold war. and we will see whether they're -- how many of
them we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the
leadership of the congress.
with regard to jackson-vanik, i think there will be
an openness to change the law if the congress is convinced there
are, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to
emigrate who are not being allowed to. if the fact is that there
is no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed
to affect, then i think that the desire to keep the law will be
much less.
with regard to cocom, my guess is, and it's nothing
more than a guess, that the leadership of congress and indeed my
own advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement
out of the cocom regime. but i think they would be willing to
begin it in the fairly near future.
q mr. clinton, when i read your speech in
annapolis, i got the impression that you have a completely
different personal -- and i stress that -- personal, not
political approach towards russia, compared to the approach of
mr. bush. could you formulate in a few words, what is the
difference between you as a personality and your approach -- the
difference between your approach to russia and the approach of
mr. bush? and who made you -- why did you cite akhmatova in the
last part of your speech?
the president: let me say, first, i do not wish to
compare myself with president bush or anyone else. i can't say
what was in his heart about russia. i can say that since i was a
boy, i have been personally fascinated with the history, the
music and the culture, and the literature of russia. i have been
thrilled by russian music since i was a serious student of music
for more than 30 years now. i have read major russian novelists
and many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know
as much as i could about your history.
and i went to the soviet union -- but it was then
the soviet union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last
presidential campaign that i spent the first week of 1970 alone
in moscow and did not return again until three days before mr.
yeltsin was elected president. but all that time i was away, i
was following events there very closely and hoping for the day
when we could be genuine partners. so i have always had a
personal feeling about russia.
i remember, for example -- a lot of you know i like
music very much. one of the most moving experiences for me as a
musician was when leonard bernstein took the new york
philharmonic to moscow and played shostakovich's fifth symphony
to the russians. and he played the last movement more rapidly
than anyone had ever played it before because it was technically
so difficult. that is something i followed very closely when it
occurred.
these are things that have always had a big impact
on my life. and i had just always hoped that someday, if i ever
had the chance to, i could play a role in seeing our two
countries become closer partners. (applause.)
the press: thank you.

176943.eml,talk.politics.misc,"since we are talking in theory and opinion, then i'll put in my .02.
first, a rebuttle. personally, i love under-dogs. unlike
bandwagon jumpers, i abandon teams when they start winning. people that
cheer for winners just because they are winners are insecure people who are
afraid to be associated with something negative.
on this one point, i agree. the reason that people bash wasp's is
because they have been on top for a long time. whoever is on top is
going to oppress whoever is below them so that they can stay on top.
if hannibal had pushed on to rome after his victory at cannae we might
all be bashing the blacks for oppressing us peacefull white people
for all these centuries. i seriously doubt that if the blacks had
conquered the world that they would have treated their colonies any
better worse than the whites did.
the white race did some unspeakable things to the other races of
the world. but they only did what any other conquering race would have done
(ie. khan). the real question is, should we carry over that blame to the
present generation who didn't participate in the crimes? would it do
any good? has it done bosnia any good? they are fighting wars that stopped
hundreds, even thousands, of years ago.
my opinion is, if there are inequities now, then let's change
them. but don't blame me for what my ancestors did. it wouldn't settle
anything anyway.
that's where you are dead wrong. you don't join up on a side just because
they are winning. that makes you spineless. winning, in high school and
after high school, is still the best way to be popular, but it doesn't make
you right. all the best causes in history were loosing causes (with only
a couple exceptions). winning only makes a difference to other people, not
to yourself. and what good is the opinions of other people if they only care
how you appear (ie. a winner).
if you can't beat them, fight them every inch of the way.

press briefing
by george stephanopolous
the briefing room
10:10 a.m. edt
mr. stephanopoulos: as you know, the president is soon
to be on his way, on amtrack to camden yards. he'll be throwing out
the first pitch.
q it's marc, the maryland area transit, it's not
amtrack.
mr. stephanopoulos: oh, it's not amtrack? well, he's
going from union station, you're right. excuse me.
q george, what exactly are you prepared to do to
break the logjam with ??? senate?
mr. stephanopoulos: well, as you know, there are
discussions between senator mitchell and senator dole this morning,
and i think that the president is going to continue to make the point
that he believes that our investment package, our jobs package needs
to be passed as quickly as possible. we need this investment for
summer jobs, for immunization, for highway construction, for the
important programs that will put people back to work right away this
summer. and the president continues to believe his program should be
passed.
q will he compromise, that's the question?
mr. stephanopoulos: well, as you know, the discussions
are going on this morning in the senate betwen senator mitchell and
senator dole, let's see what they come up with. but the president
believes his jobs program should go forward.
q george, would the president be willing to accept 8
billion for one year, which apparently appears to be the compromise
being offered by --
mr. stephanopoulos: well, i don't know what is being
offered by either side. the senate discussions are going on right
now, let's see what happens today.
q would he go that far -- no matter what the
republicans have offered so far, would he go that far, 8 billion per
year?
mr. stephanopoulos: the president believes that his
program should be passed at this time. clearly, we're going to be
willing to listen to what the senators might or might not be able to
come up with, but i'm not going to get into figures right now. let's
see what happens.
q it's reasonable to assume, isn't it, from what has
happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order
to get a vote?
mr. stephanopoulos: well, the republicans seem more
intrested in stopping progress on the president's jobs bill, than in
doing something to create -- mr. stephanopoulos: well, the
republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the
president's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action,
real jobs this summer for the american people. i think there's no
question about that. there's been some frustration of legislative
activity over the last few days.
q so, you'll need to compromise to get your package
through?
mr. stephanopoulos: we'll see what happens with the
conversations between senator mitchell and senator dole this morning.
q prepared to compromise --
mr. stephanopoulos: the president's prepared to listen
to what senator mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting
with senator dole.
q does he feel that he has been defeated in his --
mr. stephanopoulos: not in the least. in fact, he's
been very successful so far in the beginning of his term.
q how?
mr. stephanopoulos: he passed his budget in record
time, in six weeks, and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by 500 billion over five years. and it's a budget which provides for
important investments in our future. right now we've also had strong
passage of his jobs program through the house. simply because a
minority of republicans in the senate choose to perpetuate gridlock
and hold up action on the president's jobs program is not a sign that
he is not succeeding overall.
q he can't beat this, can he?
q the fact is they can do that?
mr. stephanopoulos: well, the republicans can stop
action. there's no question about that.
q what are you going to do about it?
q george, what do you know about these alleged notes
taken by boris yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears
that the president told boris yeltsin not to trust the japanese; that
when they say yes they mean no?
mr. stephanopoulos: i think that's a complete
misreading of what happened at the meeting. the context of the
conversation was that president clinton was actually reassuring
president yeltsin at the time about his conversations with prime
minister miyazawa over the kuril islands and the prime minister's
belief that japan would play a constructive role in the g-7 process.
i mean this was a casual comment about japanese courtesy and
etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where
he was reassuring president yeltsin that he believed the japanese
were serious about their commitment to the g-7 process.
q are you saying that the president said that when
the japanese say yes they mean no?
mr. stephanopoulos: that's not -- i don't know the
exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say
something along the lines that he believes that on this issue prime
minister miyazawa intends to really go forward with the g-7 process.
q have there been any attempts to explain this to the
japanese because apparently the japanese press has picked this up and
there appears to be --
mr. stephanopoulos: i've seen the reports in the
japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context. it
does talk about the japanese -- understanding the japanese points of
view. i don't think it's going to be a problem. i believe that
there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up
but i'm not positive.
q george, was the specific comment that was made
specific to the kuril island situation or was it a general
observation on japanese etiquette?
mr. stephanopoulos: the discussion was about --
q the specific comment is what i'm asking about that
has alleged to have been translated from the russian notes, ""when the
japanese say yes they mean no.""
mr. stephanopoulos: well, it was a combination. i mean
i don't think that's the whole sentence. i think that the specific
comment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific
finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that
prime minister miyazawa means to keep the commitment.
q was he saying it facetiously first?
mr. stephanopoulos: i think it was just a casual
observation.
q and then you say diplomatic contacts were made to
clear it up. has the president sent a message?
mr. stephanopoulos: no, i don't think the president
spoke; i believe that secretary christopher has made some calls but
i'm not sure exactly how many.
q well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you're
making it out to be if christopher has had to make some calls.
mr. stephanopoulos: no, no. it was just that we got
the reports in vancouver and the secretary wanted to make sure that
it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no
mr. stephanopoulos: -- reports in vancouver, and the
secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure
there is absolutely no misunderstanding, and i don't believe there is
on.
q what is our position about the japanese? that they
may have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?
mr. stephanopoulos: no. the position on the japanese
is as the president stated to president yeltsin throughout the two
days. he said that he had had a good conversation with prime
minister miazawa prior to the summit. he reiterated the u.s.
position, the long-standing support for the japanese position on the
kuril islands, but also reiterated prime minister miazawa's
commitment to move forward on the g-7 process and to play a
constructive role. and i think president yeltsin was very glad to
hear that.
q after listening to secretary christopher on iraq
for the last few days, i'm a little confused. what is the u.s.
policy? do you want to see saddam hussein overturned?
mr. stephanopoulos: it's the same policy that secretary
christopher has reiterated, and all of the u.s officials have
reiterated. we expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance
with all u.n. resolutions. right now we do not have that compliance.
q throwing it out further that if iraq complies,
saddam can't stay in office?
mr. stephanopoulos: right. i think that that's -- our
judgment is that it is not possible for saddam hussein to comply with
the resolutions and stay in power. but the important point is that
we expect compliance by iraq with all u.n. resolutions, and we will
continue to demand it.
q and are you concerned the iran will become the
dominant power in the area --
mr. stephanopoulos: secretary christopher has also
spoken to iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect
full iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping
support of terrorism.
q that's a very glib statement that he won't stay in
power if he complies with u.n. resolutions. on what logic do you
base that?
mr. stephanopoulos: right now saddam hussein is not
complying with the u.n. resolutions at all. he is not respecting the
rights of his people, as is required by the u.n. resolution. he is
not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.
he is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding
armaments.
q well, when do you think that if he did comply he
would be out of power?
mr. stephanopoulos: well, right now his power rests on
the repression of his people. if he stopped doing that it would make
it more difficult for him to stay in power.
q george, back on the stimulus package, why is it
that you and the president accuse the republicans of playing pure
politics and perpetuating gridlock? why is it that -- what evidence
do you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical
difference with you that's in good faith?
mr. stephanopoulos: well, the fact that several times
in the past the republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the
fight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now
seek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.
q george, in regards to that, some of the moderate
republicans said that the white house erred by not being more open to
them during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had
one, sort of, proforma meeting between the white house and the senate
republicans, and that was it. does the administration look back and
thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some -
-
mr. stephanopoulos: well, i'm not sure that it's true
that there was only one meeting. i mean, the president met with the
republican leadership on at least two occasions before the
introduction of his package. he met with the entire senate
republican caucus also for lunch, and went up there. we are
continually in contact with as many republicans as we can find who
have an interest in the president's package. we are interested in
what they have to say, as well. but we believe that this program is
important, and we're going to continue to fight for it.
q your all or nothing, do it with the democrats
alone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it
through?
mr. stephanopoulos: well, i mean, i think that there is
no question that under the senate rules a determined minority can
frustrate activity. i mean, there is just no question about that.
you only need 40 plus one to keep going. 40 plus one to keep going
and to stop any action, and that's what the republicans are doing.
q going to rethink the way you attempt to get
other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of
the summer?
q work with republicans and try to woo some
republicans into your camp?
mr. stephanopoulos: i think we're going to continue to
look for the support of republicans whenever we can get it on the
president's intiatives?
q but on this one -- how are you going to do it
differently than you did it on this one because on this one you
really did stiff the republicans from the beginning and made it clear
that it was a democratic majority that would get this through and
could get it through and you really didn't need republican votes?
are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for
particular votes? when you have to go through --
mr. stephanopoulos: i can't see into the future and
understand every possible turn in the legislative road. clearly the
president's going to continue to reach out when he can.
q you don't have any regrets then about the way you
have handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your
approach in dealing with the republicans in congress based on this
experience?
mr. stephanopoulos: obviously the president would like
his package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue
to press for that. we will continue to reach out to republicans,
there's not question about that. and we'll continue to reason with
them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation. in this
case the republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around
a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.
q they're being denied any other legislative means of
putting their proposals forward.
mr. stephanopoulos: i think they're being --
q any ideas.
mr. stephanopoulos: i think their amendments are being
defeated; i don't know that they're being denied.
q to present them.
mr. stephanopoulos: that's not exactly true. i mean
they get the votes --
q that theirs can be passed though by the
parliamentary rules under which they're playing.
mr. stephanopoulos: unless they get a majority in
support all the way around, no, that's not exactly true.
q george, one more on iraq. is the administration
backing any of the iraqi opposition? grooming any new leadership?
q backing any of the iraqi -- leadership?
mr. stephanopoulos: oh, i -- again, we're pressing for
iraqi compliance. i don't know if we can get into the business of
grooming leadership. i believe there have been some contacts, at
some levels, with iraqi opposition groups. i don't know about
anything recently.
q jesse jackson, who, of course, is not the
president's best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be
some kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the
president, pre-empted the ball game -- los angeles. will he consider
something like that, or any other kind of intervention there?
mr. stephanopoulos: well, as you know, the president
appointed commerce secretary ron brown, about 10 days ago, to be a
special envoy to california, and coordiante cabinet activities around
the california economic situation, including the situation in los
angeles.
i believe there will also be visits out to los angeles
by the education -- or have been visits by the education secretary,
mr. riley. i believe that transportation secretary pena and hud
secretary cisneros are also going out. and there may be other visits
by cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks. i
wouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by president clinton to
california. obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is
concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy
decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities
which help prevent disturbances. but we're going to continue to
watch it.
q george, as a follow-up, reverend jackson is also
supposed to be outside the ball park today, in baltimore, with a
group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball
management. does the president have a position on that?
mr. stephanopoulos: the president has received
correspondence from reverend jackson. i know that reverend jackson
has also spoken with the white house chief of staff, mack mclarty.
he clearly raises serious questions. there has been some progress in
baseball over the last several years, but still not enough. but the
president intends to continue to go to the ball game.
q is he going to say anything about it today, or see
reverend jackson while he's out there?
mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know if he is going to see
them, but as i said, the president believes that reverend jackson has
raised some serious questions, and it's something that, as i said,
even though there has been progress, it's clearly not enough.
q did reverend jackson ask him not to go to the ball
game?
mr. stephanopoulos: i'm not sure about that. i believe
the characterization the reverend jackson is talking about is an
informational pickett. i don't know that he asked him not to go to
the ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining
his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the
president read it.
q george, the orioles are playing the rangers, the
managing partner of the rangers is george w. bush. is he going to be
there, and is he going to meet with the president?
mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know.
q what is the mubarak schedule?
mr. stephanopoulos: i know that president mubarak is
coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a
lunch, and i believe that he is having dinner tonight with vice
president gore.
q and joint statements tomorrow --
mr. stephanopoulos: i believe so, yes. at the end,
yes.
q is there evidence, george, that the egyptians did
warn the u.s. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist
activities?
mr. stephanopoulos: as reported in the new york times,
i mean, i think that president mubarak did say that there has been
general conversations with the egyptians, as there have been for a
long period of time. we do have general intelligence sharing, i
mean. but president mubarak was very careful to point out that there
was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.
the president will continue to investigate the situation, but he also
reiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.
q george, he did make specific -- or the egyptians,
apparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who,
forgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at
the moment, and said the egyptians were more or less rebuffed in
their attempts to get some kind of action.
mr. stephanopoulos: again, i don't know if i would
agree with your characterization of the mubarak interview. he did
say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a
network in the united states and upon which we took appropriate
action. but there was no specific information on this specific
operation at all.
q so, the white house doesn't feel that any of the
law enforcement agencies whether it be the cia or fbi who would have
received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in
not pursuing some kind of --
mr. stephanopoulos: no, not at all.
q what's next with serbia? it got only a passing
mention in the news conference yesterday --
mr. stephanopoulos: you didn't get to ask your
question.
q yes, exactly. was there any agreement on concerted
action between the two countries? and even if there wasn't, what
does the u.s. do next?
mr. stephanopoulos: i think the u.s. is clearly going
to move forward in the u.n. today continuing discussions with our
allies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways
to press the serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an
agreement.
q george, why do you think sanctions is still an
option? i mean the serbians make it clear that at least the
leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait
you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day
said there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any
time soon. the bosnian serbs have said no to the peace plan. when
does no mean no and you have to do something different?
mr. stephanopoulos: well, i mean we are doing something
different. we're moving forward on further sanctions through the
u.n. and those discussions will continue. we're going to continue to
try and tighten the noose on serbia, and i think that every
opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.
q are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo?
mr. stephanopoulos: the president has said that this is something
that is under consideration.
q george, do you have any more on hugh rodham's
condition, how he's doing?
mr. stephanopoulos: as far as i know nothing's changed.
q george, -- week after mr. mubarak?
mr. stephanopoulos: it's a little unclear. i think
we'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning
after the mubarak visit.
q is he going somewhere for easter?
mr. stephanopoulos: not that i know of.
q what more can you tell us about the additional aid
to russia that the president plans to ask congress about?
mr. stephanopoulos: he's going to be consulting with
the congress and with our g-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.
i know that he spoke last evening with congressman gephardt and their
delegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the
russians this week and those consultations will continue over the
next several weeks.
q do you expect that package to be of the magnitude
of the one announced sunday?
mr. stephanopoulos: i'm not going to discuss the
magnitude.
q how about the list of cold war restrictions, where
do you stand on that --
mr. stephanopoulos: as the president said yesterday,
he's going to be looking for that list from the congress this week
and reviewing it. he believes -- he's going to try and get it this
week and he's going to review the list, and we're going to take a
hard look at it.
q but they're making it up? i mean it's no white
house involvement, congress is compiling this list?
mr. stephanopoulos: i think he's going to talk to the
congressional leaders about compiling the list but i'm certain we'll
be able to get our own researchers working as well.
q george, isn't lifting the arms embargo more of a
probability than a possibility?
mr. stephanopoulos: it's something that's under
discussion.
q secretary christopher has said that it's a matter
of time and -- for months before that happens.
mr. stephanopoulos: again, all i can say is that it's
something that the president is reviewing. right now we're working
with our allies in the u.n on a sanctions resolution, and we'll
continue to review other matters.
q george, can you tell us anything about the schedule
this week? any travel?
mr. stephanopoulos: they just asked about that. i
don't have anything more beyond tomorrow's visit with mubarak right
now.
q are there consultations, george, with any jewish
american organizations concerning jackson-vanick?
mr. stephanopoulos: as you know the national conference
of soviet jewry has a list of, i believe,
mr. stephanopoulos: -- as you know, the national
conference of soviet jewry has a list of, i believe, 200 refuseniks.
we'll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate
discussions.
thanks."

q mr. president, what do you think of jesse jackson's
protest today?
the president: i think it's an informational protest.
i think it's fine. the owners put out a statement few days ago,
which they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase
minority ownership and minority increases in management. i think we
should. i'm encouraged by don baylor's appointment out in colorado.
and i think it's time to make a move on that front. so, i think it's
a legitimate issue, and i think it's -- like i said, it's an
informational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to
the game. so, i think it's good.
q do you think they're moving fast enough?
the president: well, i think that it was a good first
step. and i think you'll see some movement now. and i think it's an
issue that deserves some attention, and they're obviously going to
give it some. and i think that reverend jackson being out there will
highlight the issue. so i think it's fine.
q mr. president, how about the logjam in the senate
on the economic stimulus plan? do you think they'll be able to break
that and get cloture?
the president: i don't know, we're working at it. i
mean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one
of the papers i saw, which pretty well summed it up. they said, you
know, this is a -- it's just a political power play. in the senate
the majority does not rule. it's not like the country. it's not
like the -- it's not like the house. if the minority chooses, they
can stop majority rule. and that's what they're doing. there are a
lot of republican senators who have told people that they might vote
for the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political
pressure not to do it.
and, of course, what it means is that in this time when
no new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an
economic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're
willing to deny jobs to places like baltimore and dallas and houston
and pittsburgh and philadelphia and portland and seattle. it's very
sad. i mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in
a hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the republicans
had always championed. just about the only democrat champions of the
program were people like me who were out there at the grassroots
level, governors and senators. i just think it's real sad that they
have chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep
americans out of work. i think it's a mistake.
the press: thank you.

bisexuals are heterosexuals? since when? which concludes that by being homosexual, you will molest children or that by being homosexual you will have the propensity for molesting children.
i haven't said that ""homosexual child molester,"" simply that is more
likely. if 26 of the molestations are by homosexuals, why are you so concerned about creating a relation between the two? if you had evidence that 95 of the molestations are committed by homosexuals you might find a relationship. ok, where is the realtionship you make?
the one that is shown when nambla marches in gay parades. also, what is the reason people molest? from human sexuality and a psych class or too i have taken the overwhelming voice says that people commit these acts as power trips and to feel in control. this has nothing to do with sexual orientation.

176948.eml,talk.politics.misc,"hmmm. human gestation period is something like 39 weeks. that means
third trimester abortions are those done after 26 weeks. in consulting
a 1989 world almanac, i see that 1 of abortions in 1983 were done at
21 weeks or more. that's about 1268 abortions in 1983 after 21 weeks.
unless the number of abortions performed has dropped dramatically, or
a lot of abortions are done between 21 and 26 weeks, i think you are
wrong.
by the way, roe v. wade allowed states to adopt very, very broad
prohibitions on third-trimester abortions, but some states, such as
california, declined to do so. it was reported that what finally
stopped third trimester elective abortions in the bay area wasn't law,
but that the only hospital doing them ran out of nurses, then doctors,
willing to do them. not surprisingly, the bay area now chapter was
terribly upset about this.
i remain pro-choice, but when pro-choicers compare abortion in a
clinic to a religious ritual in a church, you have to start wondering
a bit if the pro-life criticism of abortion as modern human sacrifice

interventionists want to do.
could we back him without forcing others to back him at the point of a
gun?
have you considered a non-interventionist policy? if market reform does
happen, russia will certainly get private capital at private risk to
help their economy. they will even have incentive to do so for the same
reason. if they don't reform, then our government will probably
consider them enemies anyway and rather spend money to hurt rather than help
them.
then their's the ideological point. we want to ""win"" russia over to
our type of government -- a type where the rulers can rule without limit
over everyone's finances?
if a 1.6 billion gift was that important to our well being, couldn't it
be raised voluntarilly? people already give over 100 billion a year to
charity.
it seems instead of gridlock on any scale, we have aid to russia,
expensive space programs, national charity that doesn't help the poor,
and probably, studies of drunken goldfish. i think limited government
is more key than how democratic it is.
that was an opinion, and libertarians are very big on free speech.
if you are pretty libertarian except on this one issue then you should
be very libertarian. consider it a compromise. how much money would
your fellow russia-aiders have to give to russia if those you oppose
weren't using the same government machine to steal money from you
and your group for causes you don't support?
people have been saying that for hundreds of years.
all the more reason to depend on the free market which can more
efficiently process information, than to depend on rulers for decisions

blacks commit crimes disproportionately, so in a perfectly fair penal

(vancouver, british columbia) background briefing
by
senior administration officials
april 4, 1993
canada place
vancouver, british columbia
9:40 a.m. pst
folks, we're about to start the background briefing
on the aid package.
senior administration official: good morning. the
president -- president clinton and president yeltsin agreed
yesterday on a series of american initiatives to support economic
and political reform in russia, and it's valued at 1.6 billion.
before taking your questions and running through the
basic outlines of this package, i want to make a few points.
first, this is the maximum that the clinton administration can do
with available funds to support russian reform. all of the funds
have been allocated and appropriated by the congress. there is
no need for the administration to go back to the congress to fund
any of these programs. all our fiscal year '93 funds currently
are available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin
tomorrow.
the second point is that this package is designed to
support russian reformers. all of the initiatives in the package
are directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have
been worked out with prior consultation with the russian
government.
third, the president is determined that we will
deliver on these commitments this year. the package is designed
to maximize our ability to support reform. in designing it we
wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we
feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in
front of you.
fourth, i'd like to note the special importance of
trade and investment. i think it's fair to say that russia's
capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend
well into the hundreds of billions of dollars. no collection of
governments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do
so. and so the president and president yeltsin agreed to make
trade and investment a major priority in the relationship.
they also agreed that there would be a new joint
commission on energy and space formed, headed on the u.s. side by
vice president gore; on the russian side by prime minister
chernomyrdin. and the goal of this effort is to break through
the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote
a vastly expanded relationship.
if it would be helpful i'd be prepared to run down
the first page, which is a summary of u.s. assistance, and just
give you some general background on what these programs are.
i'll do it quickly and then i'll be glad to take questions.
the first group of initiatives are humanitarian food
and medical assistance. this is part of our effort which has
been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian
grant food assistance so that the russian government can assure
there's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the
major cities. that's 194 million in grant -- that is from food
for progress, the grant portion of food for progress. we'll also
be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and
pharmaceutical supplies, and that's 30 million.
the second item is concessional food sales. as you
know, the united states has had a long-term grain relationship
with russia. it's important to us and it's important to russia
that we continue that relationship. the president has chosen the
food for progress program which is a concessional loan program.
the value over the next seven months is 700 million. these are
concessional terms. the exact terms have not been worked out,
but i think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on
principal of six or seven years, and concessional rates
thereafter for the life of the deal.
the third program is a collection of private sector
support. we think this is one of the most important things we're
going to do. privatization and the creation of small businesses
is the number one priority of the reform government in moscow.
and so the president has decided to create a russian-american
enterprise fund capitalized this year at 50 million. and the
goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in
russia, to take equity positions in those businesses.
the president has also decided to create a
privatization fund which would work directly with the russian
government in its priority objective of trying to convert state
enterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis. he has
also agreed -- the president has also agreed to establish a
eurasia foundation. this would be a private foundation led by
prominent americans to fund democratization projects in russia.
the fourth grouping you see there in the summary
page is democratization itself. i think it's fair to say that
this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of
pursuing democratization in russia. you see that we have a total
of 48 million in programs, various programs. the detailed
tables give an indication of some of the programs that we're
launching.
the president is also calling for the development of
a democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to
try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public
efforts now underway from the united states to support reform in
russia.
the fifth program you see is russian office of
resettlement. this is a new initiative created and
conceptualized by this administration. this is a demonstration
project. what we'd like to do is work with the russian military
to help resettle russian officers returning from the baltic
states and other parts of the former soviet union. we want to
make sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's
with russian labor and russian materials or using prefab american
construction. and so we've decided to fund on a demonstration
basis the construction of 450 housing units. we'll be working
very closely with the russian military on this. and i would say
that we have a long-term commitment to this project.
the sixth area is energy in the environment. they
are two issues that the president feels strongly about. our
initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the
possibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and
gas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in
the oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much
environmental damage.
i've talked a little bit about trade and investment,
about the new group being created that the vice president will
chair on our side. secretary ron brown will also be cochairing
with deputy prime minister shohkin, a business development
committee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy,
to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede
trade and investment. we are also going to appoint a full-time
investment ombudsman in the american government to work on this
problem full-time.
and the point i'd like to make here is, trade and
investment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an
analogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s. and we
just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a
commitment within our own government to have people work on it --
senior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly
important.
you'll notice that the united states is going to
support russia's membership in the gatt. russia has had observer
status. russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested
our advice in becoming a member of the gatt. we think that the
long-term goal of drawing russia into the global economy is
paramount, a very important goal. and that is why we are
supporting the membership in the gatt. we are also supporting
their access to gsp, the generalized system of preferences.
you'll note that ex-im has extended 82 million in
credit for a caterpillar deal in siberia, that opic has extended 150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a conoco oil
project. i'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an
agreement between russia and the united states for a 2-billion
framework facility through the ex-im bank that would finance
russian purchases of american oil and gas equipment and services.
we think this is a very important development. we think we'll
get there by april 14th, which is the opening day of the tokyo
conference, the g-7 conference.
before i take any further questions, i'd like to
defer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance
objectives with you.
senior administration official: our major
unfinished agenda with the russians and with their counterparts
in ukraine, kazakhstan and belarus is in the area of the safe and
secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory
under the terms of the start i and start ii agreements.
recently we completed in moscow three, i think, very important
agreements that devote a significant chunk of nunn-lugar funding
to three important programs. the first is the program of 130
million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement
program. that is for submarines, for icbm dismantlement and for
bomber dismantlement -- 130 million.
the second is a 75 million tranche of funding for
the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed
from the warheads as they are dismantled. this will essentially
contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the
construction of that storage facility.
and finally, a 10-million tranche of money to help
in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear
materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system. so we
add that 215-million total to the extant nunn-lugar assistance
which has been flowing -- about 150 million for some overall
safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety
measures that we have been working out with the russians over the
last couple of years.
so this is an area where we will be going a lot more
work with not only the russians but with the ukrainians, kazhaks,
and belarussians. belarus, for example, has just, in the last
couple of weeks, received up to 65 million in fy'93 funds for
safety, security and dismantlement programs on belarussian
territory. and this was in the wake of their ratification of
start i, an agreement to accede to npt.
so we are working very hard with all the parties to
the lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with
them. and i look upon these three recent agreements with russia
as a very important step in that process.
q the opic funds to -- is that for the field in
kazhakstan -- and conoco already signed this deal with
kazhakstan. why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the
same one, why do you feel it's necessary?
senior administration official: it's not the same
deal. chevron signed a deal with kazhakstan, the tenges oil
field. this is a new investment project. it's a polar lights
oil development and renovation project, and it's being announced
today. so it's completely new.
q can you tell us more about what's involved?
senior administration official: yes. conoco, like
other american oil companies has been searching for ways to do
two things. one, to prospect for new oil in siberia, west
siberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating
oil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in russia.
the objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the
natural resources in russia, increase energy production, which
will, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what
russia needs.
so we think this deal is very, very good development
for russia. the russians do as well, and it's good for an
american company. and the american government has played a
leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility
in opic and through the loan guarantee.
q so it's to search and also to renovate fields
that are already there?
senior administration official: that's right.
q on that point, should other american companies
expect to get administration support for such deals, or should
they now go to the ex-im and try to get the money out of the 2
billion?
senior administration official: well, as you know,
ex-im is part of the u.s. government and various parts of the
u.s. government have been pushing, including the state department
and the white house for this deal to be consummated. and we
think it will. and if we arrive at this agreement by april 14th,
there will be 2 billion in financing available for american
companies to sell their equipment and sell their services.
q that should take up all of the rest of the
deals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be
support for opic sort of deals such as this conoco?
senior administration official: there's a
tremendous amount of interest on the part of american oil and gas
companies to invest in russia. we think that the ex-im oil and
gas facility, the 2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will
soak up a lot of that interest. but i think the interest may
even extend beyond that. and if so, the government will respond.
q what's the current year budget costs of that 2-billion agreement should it go forward? and is there any
current year budget costs --
senior administration official: i'll have to refer
you to ex-im for that. i don't know the details of that.
q the concessional food sales -- is there any
current year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in
which the payments are due?
senior administration official: the concessional
food sales are from food for progress, which is a usda program.
usda has the funds, we don't need to go back to the congress to
expend those funds. there will be a hit in the budget. i'd
refer you to usda and omb for the details on that.
q can you talk about the democracy corps?
q and the private sector -- how many folks are
going to be involved in that?
senior administration official: why don't i start
with the democracy corps first. i think the administration felt
coming into office that there were literally thousands of
organization, private organizations in the united states that in
one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve
democratization in russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.
and there were literally 10 or 15 u.s. government agencies that
had a variety of programs in this area. and so the
administration felt -- the president felt it was important to try
to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give
some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the
efforts. and so this is a presidential initiative.
it will be headed by ambassador tom simons who will
soon take up his duties as the coordinator for u.s. assistance in
the former soviet union. and we're very hopeful that we might
use this democracy corps not only to draw upon the resources of
our own government, but the resources of the american private
sector and schools and communities across the nation.
q any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word
yet on fy'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated
besides the 300 million the president talked about?
senior administration official: the administration
is requesting additional funds in fy'94 of 700 million. what
the president has done this weekend is to consult really
intensively yesterday with president yeltsin about additional
measures the united states could take in some of these areas to
support reform. he'll be consulting with the congress. when he
returns to washington, he'll be consulting also with the other
ally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.
q two questions about the 700 billion
agricultural money. first of all, i thought it was the sort of
consensus that what russia did not need was more loans for food.
so why did you decide to do it that way? secondly, could you
explain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans
for food because of russia's inability to pay. how does this fit
into that situation?
senior administration official: as you know, the
united states for a long time has been a major supplier of grains
and food commodities, agricultural products to russia. i think
between 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history
here -- about 5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through
the commodity credit corporation. that was the principal vehicle
to ensure the sale of american grain products. on december 1 of
last year, '92, the russian government stopped its payments on
that program. they are now in arrears to us on that program, and
therefore, by law, the united states cannot continue that
program. and so the president, working with secretary espy and
other officials in the cabinet, looked for other ways that we
could promote american grain sales.
and i think we have two ways to do that. we've
announced today 194 million in grant food assistance through the
food for progress program. but we do not have sufficient
authority to spend 700 million in grant food, and so we looked
for a concessional loan program.
i think everybody agrees that russia -- that a
short-term loan program for russia would not make sense now, but
a long-term concessional loan program would. and that is what
this program is. it will provide, once the final details are
worked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of
principal. and then from years seven through 15, which is the
life of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of
interest -- generally around three to four percent. and so we
believe and the russian government believes this is a good deal
for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments
and put them into the out years, but it will also continue this
very important grain relationship, which is important for them,
and it's important for the american farm community.
q i gather from what you say that this could make
it explicit -- the russians' failure to pay the interest on ecc
loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through,
is that right?
senior administration official: let me be explicit
about that. we are prevented under the law to from continuing
the commodity credit corporation short-term credit program
because of russia's arrearages to the united states. all of you
know about those arrearages. they total about, i think, around 640 million. usda can give you an exact figure. so having
taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve american
market share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to
respond to a specific request from the russian government for
major food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the
grant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there,
we looked at food for progress, which is a program we've used to
great effect in other parts of the world. and we consulted with
the russian government and arrived at this solution.
i think the russians are pleased because it provides
them with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on
the short-term payments.
q where do those funds actually come from?
senior administration official: they come from the
food for progress program, which is a program under usda's
authority. usda has the authority to spend these funds. we do
not need to go back to the congress for these funds. and i want
to make that general point again: everything in this package,
the 1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been
allocated and appropriated by the congress. the administration
can begin to spend these monies tomorrow. and it's very
important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year,
that we meet these commitments. and we are confident we'll be
able to do so.
q how did you arrive at the figure of 700
million -- does that max out that program, or did you actually
have a range from 0 to --
senior administration official: there's a reason
for it. the reason was that the russian government told us
that's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and
harvest time. and so the idea is that we would begin the
shipments probably 100 million per month from now until the
harvest in the autumn, at which time russia won't require the
same level of food imports from the west.
q i would imagine there's going to be some
considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other
republics because of the size and the scope of this with russia.
have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for
the same kinds of projects with the ukraine, with georgia , with
some of the other republics?
senior administration official: yes, we're very
conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending
american support to the 11 other countries of the former soviet
union. we have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the
area of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that
you see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to russia and
roughly 50 percent to the other countries.
in the area of food sales, we have been active with
ukraine, in grant food assistance with georgia and armenia. we
will continue that. and i think it's fair to say that after this
summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the
other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are
productive and they're hard-hitting.
q has anything happened at the summit to lead
american energy companies and other companies to believe that
russia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of
taxing, legalities, bureaucracy?
senior administration official: well, one of our
primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight, not
only the economic agenda, but also trade and investment. and i'd
like to refer to the point i made at the beginning. we're
convinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to
support russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of
western governments have the financial resources over the next
decade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private
sector can do that.
we look at our own society and we see tremendous
capability in resources in the oil and gas sector. it is a very
good match with what the russians need now, which is financial
investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new
technology and new capital to finance new production.
that's what the russian government has told us it
wants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis
on it. that's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on
the first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently
last night in the meeting between president yeltsin and president
clinton. and we're hoping that together we might send a strong
signal to the american business community that we support their
efforts to invest in russia, that the united states, through ex-
im and opec and the department of commerce, will be there to
support them.
q my question is, is yeltsin in any position to
deliver on making russia a more --
senior administration official: we think he is. i
would note that president yeltsin's prime minister, mr.
chernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the russian oil and gas
sector. he will now chair a high-level commission with the vice
president, vice president gore, to try to break through the
barriers that currently exist to western investment in the oil
and gas sector. we believe we have a commitment to make that
committee an important committee. and we're looking forward to
the work.
q what type of mechanism is already in place to
administer the private sector portion of the program? and will
the u.s. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of
the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the
russian government for distribution at their will?
senior administration official: are you talking
about the variety of programs listed here? it depends on the
program itself. in most cases, though, we are either working
through american pbos or american government agencies to ensure
that the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to
the intended source. that's an obligation we have to the
congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can
account for the money. we have done that in the last couple of
months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of
these programs.
but they are all quite different. for instance, in
the area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it
is carried out through usda and usda accounts for the delivery of
the food. for grant medical assistance, we've been working
through project hope which is a private organization. for the
housing -- for instance, the resettlement of russian officers,
we'll be working with a group of american pbos. on some of the
democratization projects, we're working directly with russian
private individuals and private foundations. we're working with
journalists in russia on a media project that you may have
noticed.
so we literally have here 30 to 40 different
activities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be
carried out in slightly different ways. some directly with the
russian government, some with russian citizens.
q the jackson-vanik restrictions that remain and
on the cocom restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the
president has to do on that?
senior administration official: well, as george
noted yesterday, president yeltsin raised these as irritants in
the relationship. the president has noted that. i think it's
fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we
return to washington and look at both of these questions, and
we'll get back to the russian government.
q you were not prepared for these questions when
you got here?
senior administration official: we were prepared
for these questions. we've looked at them. but we're not
prepared to make a quick decision this weekend. they require --
let me just explain, particularly on jackson-vanik. they require
consultation with the congress. they require consultation with
the american jewish community. and we're very sensitive to those
concerns. and so we'll want to go back and talk to them before
we take any action.
q is this package designed so that you will not
have to go to congress for anything at this point?
senior administration official: as i said at the
beginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all
the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the congress.
so the administration will not have to go back to the congress to
seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts. in
effect, they can all begin tomorrow, and i know that many of the
agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow. and
that's the advantage of this particular initiative.
q if this, as the president says, is a long-term,
long-haul thing, and members of congress are at this moment
heading for moscow, why aren't you talking about going to
congress and suggesting to the president of russia that you are
prepared to go to congress for various things?
senior administration official: i think we've been
clear about that. the president is discussing this weekend with
president yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for american
funding of additional projects, and ideas that he has. we have a
major congressional delegation that left last night, headed by
representative gephardt and we'll want to consult with that
delegation and other members of congress before doing anything.
and we'll also want to consult with our allies. so that's where
it stands now.
q we've been told repeatedly that a number of
these items represent different or new ways of spending the money
already appropriated. could you just tick off which of these
items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways
that it was not previously set to be?
senior administration official: i think that we've
said that these are all projects that either congress had
allocated money for through the freedom support act; there were
some funds that were left over from fy'92. and this
administration took office and had some new ideas about how the
funds might be expended.
we didn't use just the freedom support act funds or
the fy'92 funds. we went into some of the agency allocations --
ex-im, opic, and usda -- and tried to look for creative ways to
further our programs.
and example of that is the food for progress
concessional loans. we had hit a brick wall with another type of
funding through usda. we could not go forward legally, and so we
looked for a more creative way to ensure continued american
market share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we
found it.
q where, for example, are you getting the money
for this russian officer resettlement --
senior administration official: that's from the
freedom support act funds.
q in other words, all of the money is being
directly spent in new ways, so to speak --
senior administration official: most of the grant
projects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the
second chart, it's broken down into grant and credits. and if
you look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that
total 281.9 million -- that is almost all freedom support act
funding. a little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year
'92. the nunn-lugar funds, of course, you know about the
legislative history of those funds.
q cooperation --
senior administration official: from fy '92? i
don't have the exact figure. it was not a considerable figure.
q could you tell us please, has anything happened
here this weekend that will break the log jam between ukraine and
russia over start -- for start i and ii as a result of what's
happened here --
senior administration official: both presidents,
president yeltsin and president clinton, will be discussing this
issue this morning. in fact, we haven't yet gotten to security
and arms control related issues. that will be this morning's
session. i know that president clinton will be very strongly
reinforcing that this is a top priority for us. we've been
talking to the russians and the ukrainians over the last couple
of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the
discussions between them. up to this point, this has been a very
important negotiation that's been going on essentially between
moscow and kiev. and we are at the point now of essentially
discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute
to this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.
but in terms of what is coming out of this weekend,
i don't yet know. in a couple hours we'll know.
q? just a follow-up on the financing here. is
any of this robbing peter to pay boris -- since it's all current
year appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been
earmarked and put it into this fund?
senior administration official: there are smoke and
mirrors here, and i think it's an important point to note. we
could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included
out-year funding. we're going to make a long-term commitment to
many of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the
privatization effort, the housing effort. and we've already
talked to the russians about our long-term commitment.
we could have put in really big numbers and this
could have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:
this package is fy '93. it's funds that we have. and we're
going to do what we say we're going to do. and the president
feels very strongly about that. in the past there is a legacy
that the western governments, the combination of governments, put
up large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not
able to meet them, we're determined, and the president is
determined, to carry out every single program in this package.
and we'll do it.
but we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's
part of the discussions on economics this weekend. we're looking
for russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively
support reform. and we've told them that we do have a commitment
on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.
q taken it way from any --
senior administration official: no, we haven't.
okay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds;
so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in
russia? the answer is no, we have not done so.
q in terms of funding, there is no available
monies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money
somewhere else. doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?
senior administration official: not at all. i
don't think it does. that's a particular example, and the
example is grain sales. the commodity credit corporation credit
guarantee program was short-term loans that russia had to pay
back within 12 to 15 months. you all know about russia's debt
problem, and russia was unable to meet those commitments. so we
looked for a way to do two things: to meet russia's requirement
for grain. they're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and
also meet our objective of making sure that the american farmers
have a chance to sell their products to russia. and we simply
look for another way to finance that. and we have legislative
authority to do it. this program has been successful in other
areas. we had not tried it before in the former soviet union,
but we thought we should now.
q isn't this really the bush-clinton aid package
for russia, since these funds were really first derived by
initiatives put forward by president bush?
senior administration official: no, i don't think
that's a fair characterization. a lot of these funds were
appropriated by the u.s. congress is 1991, in 1992. this
administration took office and inherited some obligations that
the bush administration had made. but we had a long six to seven
week review of this program. we decided to meet the commitments
that had been made by the previous administration.
but we have gone well beyond them in funding the
enterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not
been filled out with a program. there was no number attached to
it. in grouping together some projects and trying to make them
into a coherent whole in the privatization effort, i would say,
is another clinton initiative.
further, we listened to the russian government and
listened to the russian military who told us that the
resettlement of their officers was important to them for
political and economic and social reasons. and president clinton
has responded to that. and we are making a long-term commitment
that beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out
a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.
i would also say that the president has given
impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly
about what it is we can do on democratization, because there we
have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends
itself to the russian experience. and in calling for the
creation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative,
we're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private
sector as well as the american government, to achieve that
objective.
so i would not characterize it that way at all. and
as most of you know, i am a career civil servant. i was in the
last administration. i'm very familiar with what the last
administration did. and i would characterize this as a clinton
assistance package for russia.
q there's been a lot of criticism that aid in the
past has not gotten to the people. is there anything in this
outside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money
will not just disappear because it's being administered by the
russian government?
senior administration official: i think that -- i
know that the president and other senior officials of our
government are concerned that american money be spent wisely and
that it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's
intended. and so we're going to take great care -- aid and the
state department will take great care in making sure that the
funds are expended properly and that they're reaching their
source.
i would not that this package is not simply a
package of support solely to the russian government. some of
these projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are
going to be worked out directly with russian private individuals,
with businesses. the private enterprise support is another
example of that.
senior administration official: if i could just add
a word on this point with regard to the ssd-related programs, one
area that we've been looking at very, very closely is
consideration of actually using russian firms in subcontracting
for these kinds of programs. they would be working very closely,
of course, with the american firms, who would be the prime
contractors. but this is a fine example, i think, of a more --of
a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that
funding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in
russia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent
efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.
q when would the democracy corps start? exactly
when do you see this happening? how would get it off the ground?
senior administration official: well, the president
is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps. i think
it's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over
the next couple of weeks. ambassador simons takes up his duties
on may 1st. but in effect we've already started, because over
the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach
out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us
to help facilitate their activities in russia. and we've said
that we will be helpful. we've also tried to kind of coordinate
in a much more effective way the activities of our own
government. we do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in
russia in one way or another. we think it makes sense to draw
them together and to focus their efforts.
q excuse me. how much of this 1.6 billion will
actually be spent in the united states by american made goods?
senior administration official: i don't have any
figures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something
up in the next couple of days on that.
q this figure is larger than the figure that has
been in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result
of the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?
senior administration official: no, i think --
unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and
i'm sorry to say that. no, this package -- president clinton put
us to work about seven weeks ago on this package. and he was
briefed intensively on this. he contributed a lot of the
intellectual leadership in this package. he contributed a lot of
the ideas in the package. and i think it's fair to say that we
had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago. we have
been refining it ever since. we spent a couple of days last week
going over it with the russian government, both the embassy in
washington and the government in moscow through our own embassy.
and so it's been evolving. but this particular package has been
together for about two weeks.
q where is yeltsin's input into this then? there
was so much talk before about the president wanted to get
yeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.
is that in the out years?
senior administration official: no, it's both.
president yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance,
that support for the creation of private businesses is important
to him; that the resettlement of russian military officers is
important; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize
the state industries is important to them.
and so what we did was to try to make those the
centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package. we
listened to him. on the privatization effort, we have been
working with the russian government for months on this trying to
work out all the details. so the russian government on most of
these programs was involved every step of the way.
but let me get at the other part of your question.
the president is also using this weekend to talk about a broader
set of initiatives that we might undertake. and we're looking
for his ideas. the president has brought his own ideas to the
table -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in
housing. but we're looking for russian ideas not. we need to
consult with the congress; and we need to consult with the other
allied governments that are also active.
q there's essentially nothing that happened in
the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that
you came in with?
senior administration official: this particular
package, as i said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks
ago. we have since then consulted with the russian government on
the final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've
primarily talked about future, about what more the united states
and other western countries can do to support reform in russia,
which is our base objective here.
q i noticed that you -- that money appropriated
to train bankers and businessmen and officers. can you tell me
what about job training for workers who are displaced by
privatization?
senior administration official: you're right; we
have a program to train russian -- young russians in banking and
financial services in the united states. part of the housing
initiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain
russian officers who are retiring into other professions.
q money for job training for workers whose
jobs are disappearing because of privatization --
senior administration official: we have not yet
allocated any money for that.
q why not?
q of the 6 million is going to build 450
housing units. isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the
western dollar will buy in the former soviet union?
senior administration official: if you want to do
housing the right way, it's not just the building the framework
of a house, you've got to think about all the utilities. you've
got to think about the purchase of land. you've got to think
about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth. and it's also
retraining. it's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming
out of -- riga or tallin or vilnius in a house in western russia.
we think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers
as well. this is responding to a request from the russian
government.
q of the 6 million will go to retrain --
senior administration official: that's right.
q are you talking about apartment buildings or
single --
senior administration official: we're talking about
single, individual dwellings.
q you're saying that only 450 families will be
served by this?
senior administration official: what i want to -- i
thought i pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.
what we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the
germans and the turks and the italians have had in building
housing in western russian, we did not want to leap into it with
a huge amount of money. what we want to do is work over the next
couple of months and try to figure out with american
organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job
done.
i noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.
and so i would expect that we would put a lot more money into
this in the future . but we want to do it wisely; we want to
spend the money wisely.
q what is it about this program that convinces
you that it will protect russia's reforms and that russia will be
in a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back,
especially considering their other debt problem?
senior administration official: well, look, i think
it's important to note that the united states on its own does not
have the capability to fuel a continuation of russian reform.
it's got to be a collective western effort, and we're looking to
our allies to do more as well. but beyond that, it's really what
the russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform. we
can simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do
so, which is consistent with our national interests.
q did the president say that the value of the
u.s. contribution was that it would create security and
prosperity for the united states? so what is it about this
program that does this?
senior administration official: i think you have to
go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward russia,
and that is we want to do everything we can to support the
continuation of reform. we are convinced that if reformers stay
in power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear
forces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction,
which are the three benefits to the united states from reform in
russia. so it's not a simple question. you can't just say that
this program is the answer. it's a long-term question and we
have to make a long-term commitment to it.
q and then on the question of russia's ability to
repay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15
years from now?
senior administration official: well, the russian
government has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping
is that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve
their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency
revenues, that russia will be in a position six or seven years
from now to pay back those loans.
q substantial government-to-government loan
we've ever gotten into with the russians?
senior administration official: i don't want to
answer authoritatively on that. i don't go back 20 or 30 years
on this. but in the last four or five years, yes it is, because
the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to
just ensure private bank loans. this is a different type of
effort.
q government loans in any other sector that
you recall? i know it wasn't done in --
senior administration official: i think it's fair
to say this is a new and unique effort.

176962.eml,talk.politics.misc,"yes, sadly, this is true. the primary reason, and the essence of the
details that you are seeking, is that the grahm-rudman budget controls
were working. in fact, they were working so well that unless the feds
did something, they were going to have to start cutting pork. so bush
and the democrats got together in a budget summit and replaced
grahm-rudman with the now historic grand compromise in which bush
""consented"" to raise taxes in exchange for certain caps on spending
increases.
as it turned out, the taxes killed the reagan expansion and the caps
on spending increases were dispelled by clinton in his first act as
president (so that he could create his own new plan with more tax
increases).
the result is that clinton now hopes to reduce the deficit to a level
above where it was when reagan left office.

176968.eml,talk.politics.misc,"note that the laws that don't agree with you were passed to protect
a class of people who couldn't get justice from the state courts;
specifically civil rights workers in missisippi in the 60's. the

of the state. something similar has long been traditional ( well

as anatole france said; ""the law in its impartial majesty forbids the
rich as well as the poor from sleeping under bridges.""
equality of law can be construed in any number of ways. for example
the fact that all property thefts, regardless of value, are not
punished equally is an inequality which protects those who have
a lot of money from having it stolen. you could easily define
equality to regard the property in terms of it's significance
for the owner. this would a form of equality that would be skewed
toward poorer people.
in fact, most anti-gay bashing laws are constructed to offer equal
protection. they make it an offense to damage people based on a
motivation of hatred for sexual orientation. thus the law in its
impartial majesty protects hets as well as gays from being bashed.

176970.eml,talk.politics.misc,"to answer your irrelevant question, yes a person of color is human,
but i still don't know what you mean by human being and you have
merely begged the question without responding. by trying to inject
the notion of race into the discussion, you muddy the waters without
adding any insight whatever. the same parallel question could
be ""is a polydactyl person a human being?"" you still have not
answered what you mean by human being. please do so.
you won't answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancies.
if you want a definition of human being that does not depend on
the vagaries of law, but holds solid whatever the law may rule,
provide it for me.
more irrelevancies. as larry margolis pointed out, the law
has made special exceptions in order to include fetuses, but does
not follow your version of human being. and as he pointed out,
brain death is not a means of determining who has the rights
of the living, but rather who has died. there is a significant
difference.
what i am wondering now is, has your argument so failed you that
you feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the
thread you started? you got answers to your questions when
you began baiting me, if you recall, after you had made some
ridiculous remarks about adrienne regard and, having been corrected,
changed the subject with your remarks about having a discussion
of substance. if you really wanted a discussion of substance,
why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss
silly accussations, e.g. ""it really doesn't matter to you...""
if it matters to you, then why not define human being and seek
some substance? you're not going to convince a logical person
of the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic
and show some meaning to your words.
as others point out, one is sacrificed for the other depending on
which has the better chance at survival. again, your analogy
fails. not precedence, but possession makes a difference here.
a woman's womb is indisputably her own. also, i see you ignore
my statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would
not be granted a born human being. was that due to its inconvenience?
is it? please cite a precedent and the basis of the ruling.
you simply assert things without any support. your analogy is
not accurate and your assertions are unsupported. try this on
for size. it is not murder for one siamese twin to kill
the other in the womb. there. we now have equal arguments.
but the idea is illogical. for one siamese twin to kill the
other in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well. the
systems are dependent on each other for life. i'm still struggling
to see anything analagous here and failing to do so.
your argument is from fantasy island. your comparison is a total
failure, as i have demonstrated already, and has no basis in
reality, neither legally nor medically. and for you to assert
that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible,
that of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous. as i said,
you give the analogy too little credit for failure. on the one
hand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather than
a hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into siamese twins
murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each
other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe
in now way matches your version. as i said before, decisions
are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where
they cannot both survive. and, furthermore, as i have already said,
there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim
that is unequal. you seem to be asserting that a fetus has a
claim on a woman's womb. when the fetus is born, what happens to
its claim? and by what reason do you assert its claim?
you haven't answered the question. the situations are not analagous.
again you avoid the question. dependence can be transferred, and
it is not as slow as you seem to think.
yes, and i'd hate to have been the one to tell dr gunn's children that
he was murdered by a religious, ""pro-life"" fanatic. please do
try to stay relevant.
clever comeback. i congratulate you on the readiness of your wit.
what happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake?
why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her
kidney when previously the parent did not, by your standards? what
is different about the two situations? i see i have to spell this
out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you. in the one
case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born
child (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus
can), and in this case you recognize a significant difference
between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at
stake. you can't have it both ways. action and inaction are
irrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inaction
anyway. ask any of the numerous women who post here and have
borne children how inactive their pregnancy was. to have a
healthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat as
she chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks at
parties with her friends, etc. she behaves very differently, and
the provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary
than the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive.

176979.eml,talk.politics.misc,"in order of your questions, i oppose it, i oppose it, i oppose it and
(huh? wha? where did that topic come from and what's it got to do
with the discussion at hand? :-)
when i was discussing the concept of different criminal laws for crimes
against different classes of people (and yes, i do consider laws which
allow mandate enhanced penalties following conviction based upon the
convict's attitudes towards the class membership of the victim to fit
into that category), the category of classes i had in mind was that of
the standard civil rights discussion -- classes based upon race, gender,
ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc. having you ask about
classes based upon one's profession rather than one's personal
characteristics caught me off guard, and i had to think out the question
from scratch.
what i finally decided was that the law should not recognize such
classes because to do so would be to formally and officially declare
some people to be of more worth than others, and that would be anathema
to the underlying american concept of equal treatment under the law.
last year, when a federal crime bill was under consideration which would
have expanded the federal death penalty to an additional fifty-plus
crimes, including the murder of various federal officers hitherto not
protected by that ""aura of deterrence,"" critics pointed out the
absurdity of having laws which made the death penalty available for the
murder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of a
civilian teacher, when the latter arguably provided a much more
valueable service and therefore would be the greater loss to society.
this was an emotionally compelling argument, but even the proponents of
that viewpoint appeared to tacitly assume that the state should judge
some lives as being more valuable than others on the basis of their
""contribution to society."" i view that doctrine as being both (a)
personally repugnant and (b) repugnant to the equal protection clause of
the 14th amendment.
accordingly, i believe that there should be no laws which give any
profession-based class of people special protection (via the mechanism
of supplying stronger statutory deterrence of crimes against members of
that class), not even police officers, federal officers or high-ranking
members of the executive branch of the federal government."

while we're on the subject, i also believe that the supply-side claim that
reducing taxes raised revenue is also false, because they typically factor in
socsec taxes, which were raised a considerable amount, at the same time that
income taxes were cut. if you look at income tax revenue alone, it fell after
after the cuts began, and didn't recover for several years. by then, record
deficits were well entrenched. crunch, crunch steve soar"

176993.eml,talk.politics.misc,"many important issues, and some not-so important ones, are discussed here
on the net on a daily basis. i have just been informed of what i feel is
one of the most important things that we could ever discuss -- the
out-and-out censorship of one of our fellow posters because some people
don't like what he says or thinks.
we have all seen the postings here by aj teel. although many of us have
not agreed with their content, i'm sure most of us have been at least
somewhat interested in them. i, for one, am greatful to live (i thought)
in a country where people like mr. teel are allowed to say what they please.
if i don't wan't to read it, i can just skip on by, or unsuscribe. but,
unfortunately, some people cannot let others live and let live. they feel
an overwhelming need to snuff out the little bastards. now it seems that
mr. teel will be with us no more, due mainly to our brother, and cheif
net police, ted frank.
please help aj teel regain net (post) access and correct this injustice.

are your thoughts correct?
is your account safe?
has your sysadmin been contacted by the thought police?

well, well, well... thanks to (mark eckenwiler) and (ted frank), my account is to be axed.
i guess that the information i am presenting is just toooo difficult
for them to deal with. they (only ted and mark) have complained to my
sysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net. (in his
defense, mark sent only one message and it was not that bad; it has
been posted in one of the newsgroups; however, it was not directed
at me as would be common practice and i am very good at responding
via netmail...)
while i disagree with ted, i would not send mail to his sysadmin
to get him axed. name-calling was not enough; jumping on every post
i made was not enough; ignoring specific points when they were not
what the desired picture was not enough; simply ignoring me if i
am such a kook was not enough. even now i do not wish to have him
axed, but i do wish to express my disgust about this. ""argumentum
ad silence-your-opponent-um""?! i would have thought he would have
wanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and
seem sooo wise... (to himself, i think).
the issue that seems to be: ""is the following an advertisement?""
apparently, ted and mark think so...
1) i posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken off the net from last year. if reposting an article
constitutes posting an ad, then i am guilty. this post
did have a name and address and, yes, a price. if one
had posted the address and subscription price of ""newsweek"",
would that be an ad? i get nothing from showing this stuff.
2) i posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of
""proof"" that was requested by ted frank. he then complains
to my sysadmin saying that i am advertising and, lo and
behold, ""poof"", there goes my account. this one had an
address in it! oh, no! i guess that means it is an ad!
if you value the alternative view i have been discussing, or value
its discussion even if you do not agree with it, i ask that you send
a note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. they rarely get
""ya know, that user on your net was real helpful..."" or whatever; they
only get ""i don't like what that user is doing because..."".
please do not send the note to the sysadmin. i need to take it to them
in a manner that has at least a chance of getting through.
in my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying ""thanks for
the info"" or ""could you send me such and such?"" or ""your posts are
very interesting... keep it up."" and only a handfull of ""go aways"". but,
i guess the fact that i have decided not to waste my time trying to
convince ted is a net offense tm of such magnitude as to warrant
a message complaining about me. (knock, knock...""my name is ted and
and this is mark... we're from the thought police. seems you have
some pretty dangerous ideas here, and we're here to confiscate them..."")
nwo indeed!
guess i will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with
a new plan... thanks ted and mike. hope you are happy.
i will be on for a few more days and then... that's all folks!
your comments and support are requested. i can no longer post
to news. i ask what this has accomplished... is there some benefit
from making alternative views simply vanish? not in my book.
seems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side
shut up. images of waco.... ah, but alas... and all this when i am in the
process of typing in a letter to me from the tax collector saying that
a lien was removed due to a letter that i wrote challenging jurisdiction.
oh, well... it takes time to come up with the info requested, and i
was just getting started.
it should be noted that ted frank has been accused publicly over 40
times of being an nwo supporter and has never made an statements to the
contrary. further, what are ted frank's motivations for getting me axed?
we all know that some people are getting paid to collect info on people
on the net that are of ""interest"" to the government, and ted sure seems
to have a personal interest in debunking me. hmmm... just who does
he work for? the university of chicago which he ""attends""(?) is well
known as one of the biggest nwo supporters...

177001.eml,talk.politics.misc,"your statement is a common misconception, but it just isn't true. in the
german weimar system, the chancellor was not necessarily the leader of the
largest reichstag party; the chancellor was appointed by the president and
generally was the leader of a coalition of parties who could form an effective
majority in the reichstag. beyond that, the implication that hitler rose to
the chancellorship because a majority of germans wanted nazi rule is false
as well. before president hindenburg appointed hitler chancellor in january
1933, the german people did not show a particular desire to be led either by
hitler or by the nazi party. these are the results of the march 1932 election
for president, the closest hitler ever came to direct election: hindenburg
49.6 , hitler 30.1 , thaelmann 13.2 , duesterberg 6.8 . in the runoff election
in april the results were: hindenburg 53 , hitler 36.8 , thaelmann 10.2 .
so we can see that hitler personally was supported by only about a third of
german voters.
similarly, the nazi party never received more than 37 of the vote in
reichstag elections. that occurred in july 1932. in the november 1932 election
the nazis lost two million votes and 34 seats, down from 230 to 196 out of
the 608 in the reichstag. comparitively, the socialists had 121 and the
communists 100. the communists had gained 11 seats, and the german national
party, which had supported the previous government, had picked up a million
of the nazis' lost votes to gain 15 seats (up to 52). i think the other large
party was the catholic center party (i don't know how many seats they had but
i think they were declining), and there were numerous other small parties.
thus the nazi vote was on the decline at the time hitler was appointed
chancellor.
what brought hitler to power was not the demand of the german people for
hitler or the nazis to run things, but the inability of the other parties to
put their differences behind them in favor of forming an effective government
for the country. germany did not have an enduring democratic tradition, and
their parliamentary system lacked effective center parties that favored the
interests of the majority of the population. instead what they had was a
number of small parties who were unable to put aside their own specific
objectives in order to combine against the nazis, who were out to end the
democratic process. in fact, part of the problem was that some of the other
parties with substantial representation, like the communists, were also
out to end the democratic process, but with different results in mind, and
generally didn't mind seeing parliamentary democracy go under.
germany had already had a non-nazi chancellor with a majority coalition
for five months while the nazis had been the largest reichstag party, and
there certainly was no danger of a revolution in favor of the nazis.
if anything the nazis were starting to get desperate because they had failed
to get enough support to make hitler president and their popular vote had
begun to decline.
hitler was not hindenburg's first choice to be chancellor, not even his
second choice. first, von papen had been chancellor since june 1932. after
the november election when the nazis lost seats, hindenburg first prevailed
on von papen to remain as chancellor. but there were intrigues behind his back
and support for him was lacking. so then hindenburg turned to von schleicher,
who became chancellor for two months. eventually he too was unable to hold
together a working coalition of parties to oppose the nazis, who refused to
participate in any government that was not led by a nazi chancellor. some of
the nazi leadership, particularly gregor strasser who was the 2 man in the
party at the time, wanted to participate in a coalition government. but others,
knowing the party's support was waning, figured that their best hope to gain
power lay in undermining the democratic process. nevertheless, the country
was governed for seven months by chancellors who were not nazis, even though
the nazis were the largest reichstag party. the failure of these men to
achieve a working coalition was due to the inability of their coalition
parties to work together.
here's how william shirer puts it in the rise and fall of the third reich :
the cardinal error of the germans who opposed nazism was their
failure to unite against it. at the crest of their popular strength,
in july 1932, the national socialists had attained but 37 percent of
the vote. but the 63 percent of the german people who expressed their
opposition to hitler were much too divided and shortsighted to combine
against a common danger which they must have known would overwhelm
them unless they united, however temporarily, to stamp it out.
true, the german people supported hitler after he became chancellor. but
that doesn't change the fact that there was not overwhelming support for him before he was in power. the german people were not crying out for hitler to
take over, no matter how bad economic conditions were. the leftist parties
(socialists communists) probably had more support in total than the nazis.
hitler used the fact that others were passively or actively willing to see
the government paralyzed as a means to taking it over.

177004.eml,talk.politics.misc,"if we had backed him strongly early on i doubt there would be the
problem there is now. many russians became disillusioned with democracy
and reforms when they felt, rightly imo, that the west didn't care.
yeltsin was virtually promised massive aid (once bush got over his
gorby-mania.) this probably kept him from dismantling the congress
and calling for new elections. well, the aid didn't come through
and we didn't make sure it went to the proper places and now the
anti-reformers are gaining strength where before they were in
hiding.
if they don't reform i don't believe in giving them money. however,
i think this is too important to take a non-interventionist approach.
this is what really bugs me about libertarianism -- it sounds like
'it'll all be the same in a hundred years time. no need to do
anything.'
despite the wishes of libertarians, this society is a far way, and getting
farther, from being libertarian. perhaps voluntary gifts would work if
we had the proper framework but we do not have it. we have to face the
problem now , not in x years when we have a libertarian dream society.
right now there are huge stumbling blocks to trade, let alone charity.
there are still limitations to high-tech exports. nasa can't buy
proton launch vehicles from them. sure, the market may be able to
help a great deal but it can't right now. there are too many obstacles.
instead of fighting against the aid you should be fighting to
tear down the obstacles the market and charities have to face.
well, i think limited government is primarily democratic due
to it being limited. but the main question is how do you transform
a state-run economy and monolithic government into something that
even remotely looks like ours? (btw, sometimes it seems that our government
is trying to go the opposite direction) it is not going to be
painless and not going to be easy. we simply cannot wait to
help when they have the 'proper' government. they'll never
get there without the aid. it may be too late already.
and i'm just excercising mine.
as i also said above, another problem i have is with transformation .
a libertarian society is not going to happen painlessly or overnight.
i have seen nothing about how to take our current government and
society and turn it into a minimal government and a responsible
self-sufficient populace.
they didn't have nuclear weapons 100 years ago. nor instantaneous
communications nor travel to virtually anyplace on the earth in

yes, depend on the rulers of the free market and the businesses. rulers
do emerge somewhere and they will never represent the opinions of
every person on the planet.
there must be checks and balances. checks on the government when
it gets out of bounds and checks on industry when it gets out of
bounds. putting all your hopes on the benevolence of the market
is, to me, just like putting all your hopes on the benevolence of
government.

there's no ""for purposes of this act, the term 'sexual orientation' will

remarks by the president,
secretary of education richard riley and
secretary of labor robert reich in
goals 2000 satellite town hall meeting
chamber of commerce building
washington, d.c.
8:30 p.m. edt
secretary riley: good evening and welcome to all of you
in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking
part in this satellite town meeting for the month of april.
you know, today is april 13th. in 1743, thomas
jefferson was born, 250 years ago. i think that's appropriate to
mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he
has been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all
followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education
here in this great country. the success of our democracy according
to jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational
system.
his philosophy of government, his belief in the
importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest
here this evening. tonight we're so pleased to have with us
president clinton. he's come over from the white house to join us in
the chamber of commerce studios.
mr. president, it's good to have you. we thank you for
taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite
network and we welcome you here this evening.
also we have with us secretary of labor robert reich.
and, bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening
also.
i have some questions for our two guests, and i'm sure
many of you do, too. so please call us if there's something that
you'd like to ask. the number is 1 800 368-5781 or 5782. in
washington, d.c. the number is 202 463-3170 or 3171.
i believe the president has a few words that he might
want to share with us. and, mr. president, i'll ask you to do that
at this time. it's great to have you.
the president: thank you very much, mr. secretary.
i'm glad to be here with my friends, dick riley and bob
reich -- also members of my cabinet -- at the headquarters of the
chamber of commerce to support the effort that the chamber is making,
along with its center for work force preparation, to help to examine
tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people
from school to the work place.
i want to compliment the chamber on all their efforts,
recognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this
economy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to
work together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to
make things happen.
this satellite town meeting is a good example of that
kind of working together. and if you'll forgive me a little home
state pride, i want to say a special word of thanks to the wal-mart
corporation, headquartered in bentonville, arkansas, for providing
several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight. i
appreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all
the rest of you.
i have tried as hard as i could to move toward
constructive change for this country. secretary riley talked about
this being thomas jefferson's 250th birthday. if thomas jefferson
believed in anything, he believed in these three things: first, in
education; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion,
freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and
third, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.
if you go to the jefferson memorial here in this
beautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful
cherry blossoms, you will see jefferson saying that we have to change
with changing times.
for us here in america, that means reducing our deficit
and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we
can compete in the world. we're here to talk about that tonight --
about what we can do to educate and train our people better. unless
we do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in
government, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase
our investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the
long run.
we also have to have people who can carry their load.
and in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven
or eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system
and continues into the work force where education must go on for a
lifetime. it's not just important what you know, but what you can
learn.
and if i might, i'd like to close just by emphasizing
we're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership
between the labor department and the education department and the
private sector to build a good school-to-work transition. and we're
trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that
would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many
thousands that have a strong education component so our young people
can be learning and working at the same time.
dick, i think i ought to stop there. that's a good
place we can begin, i think, the discussion.
secretary riley: thank you so much, mr. president.
each month we get together and talk about ways that all
citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals. and
tonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours
can prepare students for this world of work.
this week, the education department and the labor
department are hosting a conference here in washington, d.c. called
summer challenge, a program of work and learning, to america's youth.
the aim is to use some special funds from president clinton's
proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched
jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged
areas of the country.
mr. president, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it
somewhat -- about the summer youth challenge. your program calls
for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs. and why in your
words is that so important?
the president: i think it's important for two reasons.
first of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may
have had trouble adjusting to school and learning. and while we want
them to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to
continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of
research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may
forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year
over the summertime. and that is a very unproductive thing for
schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already
taught before.
secondly, we want to help these young people progress,
not only in terms of work, but in terms of learning. we want to
abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is
learning because we think that the best and most productive workers
will have to be lifetime learners. and we think that this experience
could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to
succeed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.
secretary riley: well, i think the fact that these are
disadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go
into the next year, is really even greater.
secretary reich, of course, you have training programs
throughout the year. and i wonder is you have any comment about this
educational component of training.
secretary reich: well, what we've learned, mr.
secretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer
or for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with
education is one of the best ways of learning. many young people,
for example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning
geometry. but when they actually are there building something or
working on something, and they can see the exact and direct
application of geometry, they understand what it's used for. and a
lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between
education and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.
it's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of
young people even beyond the summer.
secretary riley: thank you.
mr. president, you've called for a youth apprenticeship
program, school-to-work transition. and i wonder if you would tell
us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it
developing.
the president: well, first of all, let's talk about why
it's important. most new jobs that will be created in this decade
will not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will
require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people
get in a high school diploma.
if you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries
of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school
education was a good salary that went up over the decade. the young
people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not
go up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because
they weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their
employers.
so we think america has a big economic interest in
trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school
but don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes
two years of further training either in a community college, a
vocational setting, or perhaps on the job. and what i have done in
this budget, as you know, is to give you and secretary reich some
funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states
and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in
a way that would be customized essentially by the business community,
based on the needs of the economy in any given area. it could
revolutionize long-term the quality of the american work force and
the earnings of american workers.
secretary reich: i should add, mr. president -- i think
you know this from your experience in arkansas -- and many of the
people watching this program -- that the business community and
educators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many
of our states, building a school-to-work transition program. in
fact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement. the
people watching this program probably are the ones who are most
directly involved in that. and more power to them. secretary riley
and i are going to do everything we can to build on the successes
already out there.
secretary riley: bob, we're going to be talking tonight
about youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning
career academies. and what features all those programs that deal
with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of
these school-to-work programs might have that are important?
secretary reich: well, one thing that we've seen -- and
you and i have been working at this for a long time, and you much
longer than i -- we've seen that active involvement of the business
community is absolutely essential. and i'm so delighted that we're
doing this in the headquarters of the chamber of commerce. the
chamber of commerce of the united states is committed to doing these
kinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've
aimed to work very closely with the chamber.
the business community is going to be actively engaged
in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and
helping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions
develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.
communities have got to come together. i mean, this is
one of the most important things. you've got to have all of these
players in a community come together and work together and cooperate
together. you know, too often we have the educators over here and
the business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody
is talking, but they're not really working together in a common
strategy.
and the third and final ingredient i would say, dick,
would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic
excellence and also to skills development excellence. this is not a
tracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to
make it. this is a program that every young person ought to be
eligible for. if they want to go on beyond that to four-year
college, that's fine. that ought to be permissible. but we're
talking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation
skills for on-the-job learning.
and again, those are the critical components. it's
already being done.
the president: i think -- if i might just interject one
point based on my personal experience at home -- the business
community has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are
the job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught,
but also in monitoring that excellence. if you have the right sort
of partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are
going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the
second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and
influence them. so i think that's very important.
and when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at
the federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some
funds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make
sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the
quality of these programs, because that's really what's going to
determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.
secretary riley: that's great. we've been talking, of
course, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery
program for this summer and fall. but let's talk just a moment about
long-term school reform. it's something especially close to me. mr.
president, i wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the
communities out here on goals 2000 legislation that i think will be
coming forth before too long.
the president: well, as you know, back when you and i
were both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public
schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that
a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.
i had a hand in writing the national education goals
that the governors drafted, along with representatives of president
bush's administration back in 1989. and what we're going to try to
do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in
congress that will actually define the things that the national
government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the
children of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those
goals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school
ready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school
graduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are
confident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are
second to none in math and science; that are schools are safe,
disciplined, and drug-free. and, of course, the fifth goal --i took
them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of
life-long learning in this country.
and each one of those goals there's a national role, a
state role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector
role. and what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to
introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is;
and then to give the rest of america a way of defining what their job
is and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality
that we need to meet.
it's very exciting. so far as i know, nothing quite
like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.
not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their
money, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and
partnerships so that we can do our job. i'm really excited about it.
secretary riley: well, i am, too. and i think really
it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms
of its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to
support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform
efforts, all driven by high standards. that's the point.
bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to
the telephone calls. it's about the same subject. we have, of
course, skills standards that are going to be part of goals 2000, and
i wonder if you would comment on that.
secretary reich: well, you know, we have 75 percent of
our young people who don't graduate from college. very often they
don't have very many alternatives. they do have a wonderful system
of community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had
national skill standards to which they could aspire and which
employers would understand as a national credential, many of these
young people would actually find that they were much more eligible
for jobs.
everybody doesn't have to go to college. other
countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to
college, but you have a whole level of people who have certain
technical, preprofessional skills. we can do it in this country. if
you don't go to four-year college you're not a loser. and we want to
develop those national skill standards. we're going to be working
with the states, with the education department, with a lot of private
industry in developing those standards. and i think they will be the
kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other
institutions to rally around, as well as our business community.
secretary riley: well, that's great. why don't we go
ahead and go to the telephone. we have a call, i see -- mayor bruce
todd of austin, texas.
q yes, mr. president and mr. secretary reich and
riley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today. we
have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in austin who
have heard what you have said and are very appreciative. let me
simply say, amen to some of the comments made already. we agree with
much of the tone that the clinton administration has taken, and are
very supportive.
we have been successful here in austin of tripling our
summer employment program over the last four years. we expect to
have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much
as 3,500 with the federal assistance.
much of the question that we had designed you have
answered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike. but
the question essentially involved what initiatives after labor day
would be appropriate. we know summertime is important. year-round
is even more important. and what kind of initiatives at the federal
level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year-
round basis? and perhaps more importantly, how can families and the
local community be more involved using the federal initiative? that's
something that we believe is very important to success in this
effort.
secretary riley: mr. president.
the president: i think i'll give everybody a chance to
answer the question, bruce, but let me first thank you for calling,
and thank you for all the great work that you're doing in austin.
i've seen some of it and i've always been very impressed.
first, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can
structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer
program and that will move a lot of these young people back into
schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in
the private sector, too. we hope that -- secretary reich is going to
try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs
to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer. and we're
working on that.
secondly, in the program that i have presented to the
congress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to
build in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job
training programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give
heavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you
asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we
hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being
trained on a year-round basis.
and i will say again, to echo what secretary reich said
a moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen
as work and what is seen as learning. an awful lot of young people
actually have quite high iqs, but actually learn so much better when
they're doing than when they're reading or just listening. so we
hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and
we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget
cuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue
raisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be
able to do just what you seem to want based on your question.
bob, do you want to say anything?
secretary reich: well, you took most of the words out
of my mouth, mr. president, as usual. but let me just add one thing,
and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high
school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in
addition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of
jobs. and we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.
it's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the
economy back on track. that's sort of the prerequisite to everything
else. if we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- i
think this is the 16th -- correct me if i'm wrong, mr. president -- i
think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or
greater. this is a jobless recovery. a lot of those kids are going
to be getting out of school in june. and even if we did everything
right, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.
secretary riley: thank you both. of course, goals 2000
will be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into
next year. it will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it
will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working
together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways. and
then the state, with all the various school districts, a very
important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement. and i
think everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that
moving.
the next call is dr. harry heinemann, new york.
doctor?
q good evening, mr. secretary. it is a pleasure to
be on with you this evening. as you may know, bridging the school
and work has been central to la guardia's educational program since
its inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two
alternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages
we have forged with the local schools. we have found this to be an
extremely effective learning strategy.
and over the years, we've come to believe that there are
several principles that are very important in bridging the school and
work. and these include integrating theory in the classroom with
practice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure
to careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect
upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and
lastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the
development of high performance competencies.
my question, then is: how can the general education
faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with
transition to work experience? and what mechanisms and strategies
can you suggest to achieve this integration?
secretary riley: well, thank you very much. i think --
and we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting
work going on there. we're going to have three people, our next
guests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists
in that area that you're speaking, and i'll certainly pass that on to
them and we can discuss it later.
you all care to comment -- any comments you might have?
the president: i'd just like to say, if i might, one
thing. i want to reemphasize this and i don't think i'm being as
clear about it as i'd like, although i think at least one of the
people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more
explicitly than i. i think this whole concept of applied academics
is very important. and i think that we have to basically abolish
what i consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is
vocational learning and what is academic learning.
i think we should keep the liberal arts going. i think
we should have a strong component for people who are in the
vocational program.
secretary reich: it seems to me that we also need to
rethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and
work combinations are important for mainstream students. they're
important for all students. it's not just a special group of
students that needs them.
some of the experiments that i've seen around the united
states -- dick, i'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream

okay, now here's my interpretation of boomer , based on the facts as
presented in the new york court of appeals holding ( boomer v. note: the new york court of appeals is the highest court in new york
state. while the united states and 48 of the fifty states call their
highest court ""supreme court,"" ""supreme judicial court"" or ""supreme
court of appeals,"" maryland and new york call theirs simply the
""court of appeals."" to make matters worse, new york also calls its second-highest court the ""supreme court, appellate division""...
atlantic cement co. , 26 n.y.2d 219, 257 n.e.2d 870 (1970)):
oscar h. boomer, et al., owned land near the atlantic cement company's
plant near albany, n.y. (the fact pattern gives no information as to
which came first, the plaintiff's acquisition of the land or he
defendant's start of production at their cement plant.) in the course
of its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the
plaintiffs' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the
plant. the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked
the court to order atlantic cement to stop damaging their property.
(commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me. boomer at al owned
their property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.
atlantic cement's actions were depriving boomer et al of that right.)
instead of granting the plaintiffs' request for an injunction, the court
ordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided
that atlantic cement paid them 185,000 in compensatory damages. in
other words, the court granted atlantic cement co., a private party, the
power and authority to take the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment
of their property by eminent domain. a taking by eminent domain is
always problematical even when it's done by the state; allowing a
private firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.
(yes, i know, the boomer court didn't call it eminent domain. but if
it walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks
like eminent domain...)
let me take issue with the way you've presented the case... you say that
""what happened in boomer was that the judge didn't allow the
plaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million
dollar plant to be shut down over 185,000 in damages."" blackmail?
(pulls out black's law dictionary, abridged 5th edition....
""blackmail: unlawful demand of money or property under threat to
do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose
disgraceful defects. this crime is commonly included under
extortion statutes."")
how do you define as ""blackmail"" one party's act of demanding the right
to set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns
and which another party has expressed an interest in buying? or of
demanding the right not to sell that property at any price? as i see
it, boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of
owning something which atlantic cement had to purchase if it wanted to
stay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price
they wanted. there isn't, or at least shouldn't be, any law that says
that you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.
you go on to say: ""the plant would never have been shut down -- the
plaintiff's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,
because the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than 185k to
having the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less
than the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation.""
if so, so what? since when are the courts supposed to be in the
business of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from
other parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those
other parties? if atlantic cement didn't want to have to face a choice
between paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,
shouldn't atlantic cement have thought of that before going into business? (i note that as far as the facts show boomer et al were not the parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was
atlantic cement's own fault for choosing to build and operate the type
of plant they did where and when they did.)
and then you say: ""everyone's property rights were protected; the
plaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided.""
as above, i dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were ""made whole.""
they were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners
of property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price
acceptable to them. and for that deprivation they were not made
whole. and again i ask: since when are the courts supposed to be in the
business of ensuring that ""unnecessary"" settlement costs are avoided?
(if so, i've been miseducated -- i always thought that the courts were
supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)
(1) boomer is not being taught as ""infamous,"" at least not at my
school.
(aside: northeastern law usually does a very good job of hiring for
their first-year, mandatory classes (such as torts, where i first
encountered boomer ) instructors who, regardless of their personal
opinions, can and do teach the law neutrally. when the students get
into their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick
and choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory professional
responsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly
and self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously
intimidated by law school professors and able to learn from openly
biased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors
tend to be more open in expressing their own opinions. this is
especially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are
practicing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be very educational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat
cloistered scholar. end of aside.)
i called it infamous because that's my opinion of it. for the reasons
i've stated above, i believe it to be a triumph of something that i can
only call ""economic correctness"" over justice.
(2) it is ""completely sensible"" only if you believe that the alleged
right of the owners of atlantic cement to stay in business and avoid
losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and
the alleged right of several hundred atlantic cement employees to
not have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who
own property which was damaged by atlantic cement's wrongful acts.
(and if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other
branch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take
other people's property by eminent domain.)
really? i didn't know that... what, if anything, has he had to say
about cases like boomer ?
i've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to
as ""law and economics"" is weak. if it advocates the use of economical
analysis as one of many ""tie-breaker"" factors which courts may use to
help them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured by
the scale of ""justice"", is evenly balanced, fine. but as illustrated by boomer , it is not fine when the courts start viewing the economics
of a case as being more important than the justice of a case."

the american indians had no concept of ownership of property, and often
freely gave of their supplies to neighboring tribes, trading food and
clothing for weapons or services. the native hawaiians, like their
polynesian ancestors, also could not conceive of that idea, and shared
many things with the other islanders. in fact, ""hi'ipoi"", the hawaiian
word for ""cherish"" means ""sharing food"". the great mahele, in which
the islands were divided up more-or-less evenly between the rich and
the poor, was a white man's idea. in africa, villagers will often
share tools, crops, and clothing with other members of their own village
and neighboring villages. every anthropologist who has ever been to
africa has at least one tale of the difficulties arising from the so-
called ""theft"" of the scientists possessions -- two concepts of which,

close naval, marine reserve centers
to: national desk, defense writer
contact: herbert m. hart of the reserve officers association of
the united states, 202-479-2258
washington, april 13 u.s. newswire -- the reserve officers
association of the united states has alerted the defense base
realignment and closure commission that the services failed to give
sufficient weight to demographics in recommendations made to close
56 naval and marine corps reserve centers.
in letters to the closure commission and to all 86 members of
congress with affected locations in their constituencies, including
sen. sam nunn (d-ga.), chairman of the senate armed services
committee, roa charged that the developers of the navy-marine list
ignored demographics of the civilian population, particularly prior
service personnel.
roa's executive director, maj. gen. evan l. hultman, aus (ret.),
suggested ""concern that the only plausible alternative is that they
are intentionally attempting to foreclose the naval reserve
components from maintaining even today's relatively low level of
participation in their parent service's total force of the future.""
he asked the commission ""to remove from consideration all
locations without sufficient and convincing demographic data to
warrant approval of the requested action.""
""only a few of the 56 naval and marine corps reserve
installations on this list are large enough to have a significant
impact on the community, if closed,"" wrote hultman. ""the major
issue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a large
percentage of the existing locations.""
hultman reminded the commission, ""the fact that the vast
majority of the reserve installations on this list do not come
close to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in this
process certainly supports the thesis"" that these actions are
simply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the navy and
marine corps reserve.
roa also noted ""that at the end of the 1960s, when the number of
naval reservists was approximately the same as today, there were 480
naval reserve facilities. if the navy recommendations are
approved, there will be less than 200 naval reserve facilities.""
facilities on the list include seven naval air stations ranging
from south weymouth, mass., to alameda, calif., 28 naval
reserve centers in macon, ga., and parkersburg, w.va., to
missoula and great falls. mont. naval marine corps reserve
centers include four in san francisco, fort wayne, ind.,
billings, mont., and abilene, texas.
a major marine reserve center on the list is that at el

'assimilation in u.s. threatens ancient zoroastrian religion' by jeanne huber, mercury news staff writer
high on a hillside above san jose, flames leap up 24 hours a day from a
gleaming brass urn in a temple - one of only four in the united states -
dedicated to one of the world's most ancient religions.
with the flames go the prayers of about 1,200 bay area zoroastrians that
their faith will survive this land.
""there is a fear - a real fear, too,"" said silloo tarapore of lafayette.
""we have one generation to do it or to die.""
many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land.
but for zoroastrians, it is an especially poignant concern.
their religion has been around for perhaps 3,700 years, a heritage so deep
it scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where ""historical sites"" are
sometimes less than 100 years old. it was the religion of the great persian
empire under kings cyrus and darius. and tradition says that when christ
was born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three
zoroastrian priests, the magi. scholars say many key beliefs of christians,
jews and muslims can be traced to the teachings of zoroaster, the
zoroastrian prophet.
yet, with only about 150,000 zoroastrians in the entire world, they are
a miniscule minority in every country in which they live. survival as a
people is very much on their minds.
ironically, local zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance
of the united states may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed
by nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause
their young people to stop thinking of themselves as zoroastrians.
zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they
actually shun the notion of trying to win converts. so if their children
become totally assimilated, they say, it's their children - rather than
the world at large - who will be the losers.
""it's important to have an identity,"" said maneck bhujwaia of san jose,
a leader among zoroastrians who came here from india. ""it's important
for everybody - irish, scottish, americans. it gives meaning to life.
you don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect.
you can fall back on your own identity.""
for zoroastrians, there's much to be proud of.
their prophet, zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which
animal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was
only one god, a good one. zoroastrians call their god ahura mazda, which
translates as lord of wisdom and light. good vs. evil zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with
the good eventually winning. men and women could join in the battle for
good, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences
such as shame and sorrow if they did wrong. he preached honesty, charity,
kindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of
men and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.
but zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to
follow him blindly. he demanded they think for themselves. in fact,
joseph campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths,
traced the western emphasis on individual thought to the zoroastrians.
zoroastrians have many words for thought. their motto, leaded into a
stained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of
mount hamilton, is ""good thoughts, good words, good deeds.""
so it's not surprising that zoroastrians value education highly. in india,
where a contingent of zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape
persecution by muslims in iran, zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy;
the overall statistic in india is just 60 percent.
about half of the bay area zoroastrian community came here from india
and pakistan, mostly to study at universities. the other half fled from
iran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist islamic state
where others had no rights.
local zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on ""good
deeds"" has improved life in every country they inhabit. in san jose,
the recent restoration of the hotel sainte clarie came about because
manou mobedshahi, a san francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up
downtown landmark on his way to and from the temple. at the temple's
dedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of zubin mehta, the
zoroastrian conductor of the new york philharmonic orchestra.
the temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an
iranian emigre, the late arbab rustom guiv, to buy land for six temples
in north america. besides the 10-acre site off crothers road on mount
hamilton, he paid for land in los angeles, chicago, new york, toronto,
and vancouver. until his gifts, there were no zoroastrian temples on
this continent.
local zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the
property already had a large house that they have converted to a
community center.
the temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet
zoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted
ceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge oriental carpets.
its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed-
in area at the center of the building. although zoroastrians are
sometimes called ""fire worshippers,"" they actually consider fire just
a symbol of god. ""it helps us concentrate, just like christians use the
cross and muslims use the holy book,"" bhujwala said.
the biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring. for all
iranians, including zoroastrians, the new year begins on the first day of
the season because of its symbolism as the start of new life. with
zoroaster's birthday just six days later, the combination of religious
and secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the
united states celebrates between christmas and jan. 1.
for this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday, about 500 people
came to worship and revel.
""the good things in life are not forbidden,"" esfandiar anoushiravani,
a leader of the iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed
proved him right.
inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood
around the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted
thanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking
sandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit
and nuts.
kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats. ""people eat the
fruit,"" tarapore said. ""it's a way to participate in the ceremony."" santa claus, sort of the gathering even had a santa claus, iranian style. with flowing white
hair and a bag of gifts for the children, this amownaroz wore green
symbolic of spring) and red.
he was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, hajefyrouz, who danced and
played a tambourine.
the zoroastrians from india were charmed. ""this is all new for us, too,""
one told a visitor who asked what was going on.
a visitor, john a. sabanovich of folsom, said he became intrigued with
the religion years ago while on business trips to iran. zoroastrians have
no procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their
centuries of persecution in iran followed by their promise to the hindu
king who allowed them into india that they would not interfere with his
people's religion.
but that does not stop sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the
san jose temple whenever he can.

82779.eml,talk.religion.misc,"isn't that interesting?! in the jewish tradition you are incredibly
wrong! they originate in the torah and with jewish ancestors,
specifically the patriarch abraham (z""l). that knowledge was sent east
to india and china when abraham gave ""gifts"" (the commentators to jewish
scripture say this was the knowledge of the occult arts) to all the rest
of his children when he sent them away to the east. this assured that
isaac only, who remained with abraham, would inherit his most important
spiritual gifts, what eventually became judaism.
so you see, other religions can have very parochial views too. by the
jewish view, you are very mistaken, your scripture are not scripture,
your gods are not gods, your practices a jumble of errors that lead
people to idol worship and away from god. that doesn't stop us from
respecting you to the extent of not trying to convert you or proselytize
you and being willing to dialog in a respectful manner. we're content
to let you live the way you care to live as long as you leave us be. we
are happy to co-exist as long as you give us the same right.
but your incredible rudeness and violent nature seems to preclude that.
too bad. is this typical of your religion?
you are a most presumptuous fellow! how dare you presume that the
""typical"" new ager doesn't acknowledge god and is selfish. what trite,
self-righteous, ego-ful garbage! there are buddhists, christians, jews,
and those of many other religions here on this newsgroups for whom your
words are simple slander.
of course, from the jewish perspective you are incredibly wrong. we'd
say that there is no ""godhead"" -- just created beings who may be
enjoying a good laugh at your expense.
so not only are we selfish, we are also thieves and liars! and you
expect any of us to pay attention to you and your ""religion?"" why not
call us more name? maybe then we'll all convert in gratefullness!

82781.eml,talk.religion.misc,"(hudson) if someone inflicts pain on themselves, whether they enjoy it or not, they are hurting themselves. they may be permanently damaging their body.
that is true. it is also none of your business.
some people may also reason that by reading the bible and being a xtian
you are permanently damaging your brain. by your logic, it would be ok
for them to come into your home, take away your bible, and send you off
to ""re-education camps"" to save your mind from ruin. are you ready for
that? (hudson) and why is there nothing wrong with it? because you say so? who gave you the authority to say that, and set the standard for morality?
why?
because:
i am a living, thinking person able to make choices for myself.
i do not ""need"" you to show me what you think is the way; i have observed
too many errors in your thinking already to trust you to make up the
rules for me.
because:
i set the standard for my own morality, and i permit you to do
the same for yourself. i also do not try to force you to accept my rules.
because:
simply because you don't like what other people are doing doesn't give you
the right to stop it, hudson. we are all aware that you would like for
everyone to be like you. however, it is obnoxious, arrogant thinking like
yours, the ""i-know-i'm-morally-right-so-i-can-force-it-on-you"" bullshit
that has brought us religious wars, pogroms against jews, gay-bashing,
and other atrocities by other people who, like you, ""knew"" they were
morally right.
(me) (hudson) aren't you? aren't you indicating that i should not tell other people what
to do? aren't you telling me it is wrong for me to do that?
it is not a moral standard that i am presenting you with, hudson. it is
a key to getting along in life with other people. it is also a point of
respect: i trust other people to be intelligent enough to make their
own choices, and i expect the same to be returned. you, on the other
hand, do not trust them, and want to make the choice for them--whether
they like it or not.
it is also a way to avoid an inconsistency: if you believe that you have
the right to set moral standards for others and interfere in their lives,
then you must, by logic, admit that other people have the same right of
interference in your life.
(yes, i know; you will say that your religion is correct and tells you that
only agents acting in behalf of your religion have the right of interference.
however, other people will say that you have misinterpreted the word of
god and that they are the actual true believers, and that you are
acting on your own authority. and so it goes).
(hudson) who gave you the authority to set such a moral standard for me to tell me that i cannot set a moral standard for others?
you can set all the standards that you want, actually. but don't be surprised
if people don't follow you like rats after the pied piper.
at the most basic form, i am not going to let you tell me what to do;
and if necessary, i will beat you to a bloody pulp before i let you actually
interfere in my life.
now, at a more humane level than that, i recognize that all people are
sentient beings possessed of intelligence and capable of reason. i also
recognize that they, like i, appreciate being treated with respect and
allowed to make their own decisions."
82782.eml,talk.religion.misc,"(hudson) so. why is someone elses will such a big deal if morality is all relative.
i don't believe i ever said that morality was all relative.
what i said was that i can make my mind up on my own, thank you, and that
you don't have the right to tell others what to think.
i think that you will find that in most moral systems, there is
a respect for human life and the dignity of the person. it is all the
stuff besides these points that forms the core of the disagreement between
primitive moral absolutists like yourself and the rest of us. (hudson) maybe (the insane lover of pain might reason) if other people experienced enough pain, they might learn to enjoy it, too.
fine. there is still the clinical definition of crazy. and this also
involves a violation of free will, because the insane lover of your
little example would be inflicting pain on a non-willing subject.
try again.
(hudson)
(me) (hudson) you have to have some sort of premise about choice or self-awareness.
no, you do not. i demonstrated to you the example of the football
team which doesn't require premises about freedom of choice or
sentience self-awareness.
as i said, you are wrong, and you don't seem to know much about moral
systems. if i were you, i would take david bold's suggestion and do some
reading on the subject before you try preaching about it."
82783.eml,talk.religion.misc,"it violates free will, hudson.
(me) (hudson) why is making someone a less productive member of society immoral?
hudson, you are screwing up again. morality does not (i say again, does
not) define only ""right and wrong"". it also defines ""acceptable social
behavior"", without any overtones of good and evil. picking up your trash
is not really a right wrong moral issue in the eternal sense of good
and evil. yet it is moral in the sense that it is acceptable social
behavior"".
your definition of the word ""morality"" is what is causing you to trip over
yourself here. (me) and since i, selfish being that i am, want to maximize my gains from society, i will not do anything to another member of society if that action might cut down on how much benefit i can derive from society. (hudson) why is your benefit somehow related to morality.
again, your definition is causing you to shoot yourself in the foot. (hudson) what about if someone feels that their own personal benefit is enhanced more than it would be damaged by depleting the overall resources of society? maybe something might hurt society, but it would help him immensly?
that is irrational thinking.
there may also be people out there who think that death by atomic
destruction is a sublime and wonderful thing. i am not going to let them
execute that idea just because they want to do it.
simply because i let people make up their minds about what morals they
have doesn't prevent me from spotting and stopping a madman when i see
one, hudson. and even then, i will only stop him when he interferes
with me and my life. that is the difference between me and you: you
want to interfere in people's lives even when they aren't affecting
you. (hudson) the central character in dostoevsky's novel, crime and punishment, (r something or other) reasoned that if killed this old jewish woman and stole her money to educate and establish himself financially, he could make a great contribution to society. he reasoned that she was not of much profit to society. she just collected rents, and hoarded money.
one of the central points of any (that's any) moral system is that is
has to be internally consistent.
by killing her, the character had to accept the premise that the ends
justify the means. if he accepted that premise, then (in order to be
consistent), he must accept the idea that some day another person may
apply the same standard to his life. now, if he is unwilling to accept
this premise (which he will not be willing to accept), then he has
behaved inconsistently with his own moral standard. (me) football example deleted (hudson) now suppose a freshman on the bench will only get to play if one of the players in the field on the court is injured (or killed.) this freshman wants to play in the big game so a talent scout can see him. if he hurts a player on the team, it might slightly lessen the chances of the team to win, but he might gain great personal benefit. so, operating on purely selfish (immorally selfish) motives, he arranges for a sniper to shoot a team player in the leg. he gets to play in front of the talent scout. did that freshman behave morally? selfish intentions may sometimes generate (apparently) moral actions, but not always.
two problems right off the bat:
1. the problem with your analogy is that it doesn't address the goal
that i started with: winning the game. playing in front of the talent
scout ! winning the game. try creating the same analogy and keep the
ultimate goal the same, will you?
2. the internal consistency question is also not addressed: if the freshman
wants to do this to other people, then he has to accept the fact that
it may happen to him one day. if he is unwilling, then he has violated
his own moral standard."
82784.eml,talk.religion.misc,"(hudson) if all morality were relative- big hairy deal.
as i said, you appear to be the only person saying that all morality
is relative. most people i know do hold some absolutes in their
moral system.
i personally believe that the dignity of the individual and the right
of free will are absolutes. i recognize that there are some moral
systems around which don't accept this; i reject them as dangerous
and anti-social (nazism, some forms of communism, fundamentalist
xtianity--no, that's not a slam). but for the most part, almost
every moral system agrees on these two points.
(me) (hudson) generally, christians believe in a creator-creation distinction. other religions believe in one big whole. i don't accept yor premises.
too bad. i know i'm right, so i get to enforce my view upon you whether
you like my premise or not. and since you can't prove otherwise, there
isn't even an intellectual basis for your resistance to accepting my
viewpoint. (hudson) i don't think so. once morality becomes relative, it degenerates. i am saying that reasoning that it is generally evil to hurt other people is bad. (though i don't think it is sufficient.)
well, then answer me this: you seem to be opposed to moral relativism
(as you call it) because it has the capacity to degenerate. obviously,
then, you would advocate a nonrelative (absolute) moral system.
whose absolutist moral system do we choose?
how do we come to this decision?
what about people who disagree with the chosen moral system? (hudson) but if morality is considered to be relative, and this rule isn't based on anything, but is just an arbitrary rule, people might abandon it.
fine. i can agree with most of what you typed here. however, just because
morality gets based on something nonrelative does not mean that we have to
pick your xtianity as its base.
we can start a morality based on dignity of humans, freedom of choice,
tolerance, etc. and never ever rely on xtianity for anything. just because
someone has a consistent moral system based on true principles does not
mean that they have to involve xtianity in it. xtianity certainly does not
have a monopoly on principles of behavior; indeed, fewer religions are
guiltier of violating their own principles"
82785.eml,talk.religion.misc,"(hudson) why does that make something immoral?
because you are not being consistent. moral systems must be consistent.
a person who thinks they can inflict pain on others, but doesn't want it
inflicted upon themselves, has a double standard. and double standards are
a violation of any moral system.
(me) (hudson) of course we don't like pain. i don't like brussel sprouts. are brussel sprouts immoral?
pain isn't immoral, stupid. pain itself is just a physiological
reaction.
what is nature is not a sentient force; there is no choice involved. therefore, no question of morality. (hudson) i actually heard a geologist entertain the notion that matter had a will. there is some sentient force out there.
fine. i have also heard that the government is encoding the dna for
a new race of superhumans in ordinary drinking water.
what's your point? (hudson) if humans are made only of matter, then choices are also chemical reactions, so why is choice an important issue.
and if that is the case, then god is only an idea contained in the minds
of people (formed of matter) and on printed pages (also formed of matter)
and does not really exist.

82795.eml,talk.religion.misc,"since it would do no good to rebut what mr. weiss has stated on the origin
of the nicene creed and its status as devine and inspired (i say ""no good""
because it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not
the authors of the creed were inspired), i leave you (it will be some time
before i post again) with the following thought authored by eugene england,
professor of english at brigham young university. mr. england wrote the
following as part of a book review section in this people's magazine (spring
1993 edition):
""i conclude with a little sermon because i believe we will not be a mormon--
or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other
with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (christian
or non-christian -- hal 8 ). when we are tempted to draw a circle around
a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it american, then exclude
those who don't fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central
defining characteristic of a good american might be ""one who doesn't draw
exclusive circles"" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the
central american ideal is by excluding others. and when we are tempted to
draw a circle around ""mormon"" or ""christian,"" to decide who is ""orthodox""
and who isn't by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider
that the central pillar of christ's ""orthodoxy"" is our ability to love
unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.
""i recently spent some time in a ""christian"" bookstore in california. the
service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and
well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural
commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.
but i was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking
others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern american
culture, or other religions. a whole section was devoted to ""cults and the
occult,"" and as you might expect, mormonism was right there under the same
rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as satanism. and i found
i could either rent or buy (in english or spanish) copies of the god makers
(that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous
anti-mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations
of the nazi films that scapegoated jews in the 1930s).
""it seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to
christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety (""perfect
love casteth out fear,"" i john 4:18). i have always been pleased that the
lds church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though i find a
disheartening increase in willingness of individual mormons to engage in the
same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive
action---as the ""religious right wing"" has launched this year against the
political left and american cultural and religious styles they don't like.
it is a fearful irony that in so doing mormons take common cause with the
very people who have most slanderously attacked mormons---people who would,
if they had power, forcefully restrict mormons' rights along with those of
others they believe to be evil.""
the above ""sermon"" was addressed to the lds audience who usually subscribe
to this people's magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who
rely on the mercies and grace of jesus christ to bring us back into his
arms.
even though the lds church claims devine authority to exercise the principles
of the restored gospel---as in the days of christ, the church does not claim
perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do
now lead the church. i, for one, do not wish to be labelled ""christian"", if
those who profess themselves as christians attack my beliefs because they are
intollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret biblical
scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication
than mainstream christianity would give it. once again, being in the
majority does not in and of itself prove anything except that your collective
voice is louder. that's really all the critics of the lds church have to stand
on in terms of the kind of biblical interpretation used as proof to counter
the lds church' interpretation! using someone elses biased research of truths
and non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to
disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves.
let us simply agree to disagree, and share beliefs through adult discussion
and conversation, thereby uplifting everyone.

about 20 years ago, national lampoon had some comic strips
in them that were drawn by neal adams. they were called ""son o' god"" comics.
it was a parody of the jesus in the bible. in the comic, there were a
group of thirteen jewish kids from brooklyn, and when one of them said
the magic word, he turned into ""son o' god."" he went from a myopic,
curly headed, yarmulke wearing boy to a replica of the stylizied
portraits of jesus --- with long flowing brown hair and gentile
features.
now, if someone were to profess faith in this natlamp jesus,
and claim that they were a christian because they believed in this
natlamp jesus, we would have to say that this was fallacious since
this jesus was a fabrication, and did not really exist.
this is the exact same thing that the lds do when they claim
that they are christian. they profess faith in jesus, but the jesus
that they profess to have faith in is as much a fabrication as the
natlamp jesus was. robert weiss"

r."
82800.eml,talk.religion.misc,"no matter how ""absurd"" it is to suggest that a common moral system created by
mankind is absolute, it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common
moral system created by mankind is sensible. in fact, for the bible to be of
any use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a
workable moral system created for everyday use.
the jewish talmud is the result of centuries of biblical scholars analysing
every word of the torah to understand the morality behind it. the children of
israel were given a very strict set of moral, civil, judicial and ceremonial
laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance
of moral dilemma in their society. for a christian, the situation is no better.
it seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the judeo-
christian god is that which is contained in the bible (which we can see from
the diverse opinions in the christian newsgroups is not clear). there may well
be an absolute morality defined by the judeo-christian god for mankind to
follow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was
written down by man.
this leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. if we take the
divine morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many
different ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the
fifteenth century and the interpretation of the bible which allows a man to do
that to another man under the precept to administer justice). if we take an
agnostic morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit
society (with all the danger that this implies). alternatively, we could take
the basis of the judeo-christian morality and interpret extend this to create
and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables
the people to live righteously (as many christian and non-christian philosophers
have done).
whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, i
think the important aspect is the result.
david.
on religion:
""oh, where is the sea?"", the fishes cried,
as they swam its clearness through."
82801.eml,talk.religion.misc,"the bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of
being. the warring opposites within us are a product of man's
rebellion against god, which is described so vividly in the pages of
the scriptures.
man was created with the order to become a god. those were the words
of st. basil in the fourth century. what he was trying to say was
that god created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. in the
eastern orthodox church, this is called ""theosis,"" or ""deification.""
one can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul,
and body operating in unison. the story of adam and eve is a picture
of the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. theirs
was a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the
creator. that innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed god,
their natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly
irreconcilable halves. immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in
their lives. they become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering. this
is symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.
the beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. if it
were to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil,
its paradisiac state would also be destroyed.
was it the intention of the creator to leave man in this state of
innocence all the days of his existence on earth? or was the gaining
of self-awareness carefully staged by god, who did not desire that his
masterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?
god must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral
value, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. there
is no other way to achieve union with god.
jesus christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities.
he was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites,
and making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become god,
not in his essence, but in his energies.
the opposites is the christian problem. the apostle paul describes it
with the utmost precision in romans 7:15-24. and he follows with the
answer to his dilemma in vs 25.

that it caused to to rediscover bullinger's exegisis. i did not realize

it .""

convincing....he should specify which parts of bullinger he finds convincing

find the exegisis convincing or not?)""

others is to diseminate many different views of possible reconciliations
raised by various bible scholars and students alike. when i present my views,
i will clearly distinguish them from now on.

""of course without archer and bullinger we find that mr decenso has presented
no greek exegisis at all, and mr decenso has made a big thing about my not
referring back to the actual greek. thus we find this demand on his part for
quality greek exegisis to be a hypocritical requirement.""
my reply...
good point. but in your declaring that these passages are contradictory, you
have produced only superficial reasonings and observations. nor have you dug
deeper. i'm glad you have begun in this post. i will begin greek studies on
these passages in more depth than i thought necessary, as well.
db...
""it would be appropriate to look at what mr decenso has actually used as
evidence. now we know what he claims for a standard, as he has stated it
often enough:
but are these actual standards he has used, or simply empty hyperbole. let's
see, he has used (a), and since he is trying to reconcile it to other
passages, we see that he has also used (b). on the other hand he has
presented no use of:
(d) historical context or
(e) historical content or
(f) other pertinent historical info or
(g) cultural context or
(h) cultural content or
(i) other pertinent cultural info or
(j) grammatical construction or even
(k) hebrew and greek word studies remember, archer and bullinger don't count thus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings.""
my reply...
question: do you find such criteria important? if so, do you plan on starting
to use them to the best of your ability, or will you continue to present
shallow observations (i don't mean this in a bad way).
at this point in our debates , i have not found it necessary to present a
total exegetical analysis of these passages, since we seem to keep beating
around the bush and not getting into the core of the verses. i do not believe
it necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re:
judas in acts and matthew, but i will do my best from this point on to use
several of the above criteria, since you desire me to. i hope you will also.
it will greatly enhance our study of these passages.
db...
""the only thing he has actually used, beyond the passage itself, is any other
passage. thus mr decenso should be honest and note that most of his list is
red herring and his only real criteria seems to be:
my reply...
the reason is simple...you are mistating the passages. you claim that the
passages contradict one another; i do not see the passages contradicting one
another.
(1) they may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention;
(2) matthew may not be presenting judas' death, as you claim. but we'll look
at your defense of this later.
also, the ""reward of iniquity"" in the acts passage may not be the 30 pieces of
silver in matthew's passages. (although you have a valiant attempt later at
stating why you believe it is).
at this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some scriptural
groundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis.
db...
""of course the only reason i can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage
as he has done with judas' death, is to make it agree with another passage so
that both could be considered correct.""
my reply...
one of the reasons i have given a different exegetical view of the passages is
that you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these
passages are complimentary. however, i see no problem in tony rose's
explanation of judas' death... how would you explain the inaccuracy between judas hanging
himself in matthew 27:5 and ""falling headlong he burst open"" this question of the manner in which judas died is one with which we are
constantly confronted in our travels. many people point to the apparent
discrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error.
some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant bible is
destroyed by these contradictory accounts. however, this is not the case at
all.
matthew relates that judas hanged himself, while peter tells us he fell and
was crushed by the impact. the two statements are indeed different, but do
they necessarily contradict each other?
matthew does not say that judas did not fall; neither does peter say that
judas did not hang himself. this is not a matter of one person calling
something black and the other person calling it white. both accounts can be
true and supplementary.
a possible reconstruction would be this: judas hanged himself on a tree on the
edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of hinnom. after he hung there
for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and judas
fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.
the fall could have been before or after death as either would fit this
explanation. this possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the
valley of hinnom is examined. from the bottom of the valley, you can see
rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.
there are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.
therefore, it is easy to conclude that judas struck one of the jagged rocks on
this way down, tearing his body open. it is important to remember that we are
not told how long judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced
was the decomposition of his body before his fall.
louis gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself.
this individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a
pistol at his head. he then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at
the same time.
on the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting
himself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping
form the tall building. in this case, both are true, as both are true in the
case of matthew's and peter's accounts of the death of judas. it is merely a
situation of different perspectives of the same event. your only reason for rejecting this is, i believe, your attempt to discredit
inerrancy. you haven't related how this is impossible or highly unlikely.
here's what you said in an earlier post... db quoting tony rose ...
""the added text in this version is so heavy that, assuming you are truly so
opposed to such tactics, you should find it not credible. but you seem to
find tony rose's eisegesis satisfactory, while clearly rejecting david
joslin's."" here, you discredit tony's explanation based on what you deem too ""heavy"" for
the passages. but you haven't addressed why you feel that way. you can say
it's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn't tell me it
didn't happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility.
questions: is matthew lying or is luke lying? or are they both lying? or
are either or both of them misinformed? why do you think there is such an
alleged contradiction? i do not think you have ever told us what you believe
in this respect.
db...
""at present though, mr decenso only asks two questions of me:
actually i find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but i will answer
it because he now restricts himself to two points. first i would point out
that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life. in fact it is a
bit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy
movies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.""
my reply...
i work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect. today, i got a
call re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother
is on crack. he failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a
local hospital. hanging attempts are not always successful.
to assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is
""begging the question"", if i may quote you. last night, listening to the bible answer man broadcast, the christian
research institute's show, one of the scholars on there used several of these
terms that you use. i am not all that familiar with them. the man on the bam
show teaches comparative religion and logic. it was interesting db...
""this is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other
qualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself.""
my reply...
qualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an ot passage i'll mention
below.
does hanging always have this outcome? did matthew, who is the only source we
have re: judas hanging himself, state that judas died as a result? to say it's
synonymous means it has the same meaning as. a boy (age 14) hung himself. but
he lived. this is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can
discover.
db...
""now i am not alone in this thought; in fact, since mr decenso so respects
christian scholarly (including greek scholars) opinion, i did some research.""
my reply...
thank you, dave.

""interestingly, not one of the christian references i read, interpreted the
hanging as being anything but a fatal suicide. my reply... above, mine so it's ok to use christian sources to back your points? what about tony's
position. do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility?
also, is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong, or lying, or
deceived in other parts of their books? if so, should we do, as we have done
with archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including
their ""interpretation"" of the hanging of judas? i am sure you would find
some errors and maybe even some deception in those sources.
you also noted they ""interpreted"" the hanging as meaning he died. although
that is very possibly true, do you find that in the text itself? remember,
that's the first criteria we must examine.

""in each case, these references specifically describe that the interpretation
of matt 27:5 as successful, suicide and thus i can only conclude that the greek word ""apagchw""(ie: hang oneself) is translated as a successful hanging.""
my reply... above, mine no you can't only conclude this, although, as tony says, this was a highly
probable outcome. but matthew does not state death as being a result.
the greek word is apagcho. matthew 27:5 is it's only occurrence in the new
testament.
in the septuagint (the greek translation of the ot used at the time of jesus),
it's only used in 2 samuel 17:23 : ""now when ahithophel saw that his advice was
not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his
city. then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he
was buried in his father's tomb."" notice that not only is it stated that ahithophel ""hanged himself"" gr. sept.,
apagcho , but it explicitly adds, ""and died"". here we have no doubt of the
result.
in matthew, we are not explicitly told judas died.
also, there is nothing in the greek to suggest success or failure. it simply
means ""hang oneself"".
db...
""but mr decenso, you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable christian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful.""
my reply... above, mine ""reputable""? you mean ones that have never erred?
as far as insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful, that can't be done,
even by me. as i said in an earlier post... although i still agree with tony's exegesis as being the most probable
explanation regarding judas' death (taking into account several criteria),
i've recently noticed some new things in matthew.
mat 27:5-8 then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,
and went and hanged himself. but the chief priests took the silver pieces and
said, ""it is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the
price of blood."" and they consulted together and bought with them the potter's
field, to bury strangers in. therefore that field has been called the field of
blood to this day.
first of all, notice that the text does not say that judas died as a result of
hanging. all it says is that he ""went and hanged himself."" luke however, in
acts, tells us that ""and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all
his entrails gushed out."" this is a pretty clear indication (along with the
other details given in acts - peter's speech, the need to pick a new apostle,
etc.) that at least after judas' fall, he was dead. so the whole concept that matthew and luke both recount judas' death is highly probable, but not clear cut. i also wrote... my reply...
here we have a stickler, dave, that i have to say i just recently noticed.
let's look at the passage in matthew:
mat 27:4 saying, ""i have sinned by betraying innocent blood."" and they said,
""what is that to us? you see to it!""
mat 27:5 then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,
and went and hanged himself.
mat 27:6 but the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, ""it is not
lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.""
mat 27:7 and they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field,
to bury strangers in.
mat 27:8 therefore that field has been called the field of blood to this day.
notice verse 5...""then he...went and hanged himself.""
matthew does not say judas died, does it? should we assume he died as a
result of the hanging? what does acts say?
act 1:18 (now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and
falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.
act 1:20 ""for it is written in the book of psalms: 'let his dwelling place be
desolate, and let no one live in it'; and, 'let another take his office.'
here we may have a graphic explanation of judas' death....so, my line of
reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re:the ""two"" accounts of judas'
death is this...matthew doesn't necessarily explain how judas died; he does say judas ""hanged himself"", but he didn't specifically say judas died in the
hanging incident. however, acts seems to show us his graphic demise. therefore, there is no
contradiction between matthew and acts re: judas' death'.
.......
my reply...
...we do know from matthew that he did hang himself and acts probably records
his death. although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging
and hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, i can no longer assume that to be
the case. therefore, no contradiction. matthew did not say judas died as a result of the hanging, did he? most scholars believe he probably did, but...? i quoted all that to show that i highly regard the scholars' explanations, but
in looking at the texts initially, we can't assume judas died. it is, however,
highly probable. db...
""by the way, while all agree that judas died from the hanging, the books had
different ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing. one
simply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to matthew's version as
the correct version in both matt and acts. ""the biblical knowledge commentary""
suggested the hypotheses that judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly
exploded (which doesn't explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope
broke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn't explain
how a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first).""
my reply...
the outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person
was suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may
have deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell
upon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc. in a
superficial examination of the acts passage and the matthew passage, we are not
given a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but tony in the above quoted
post gave us some... a possible reconstruction would be this: judas hanged himself on a tree on the
edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of hinnom. after he hung there
for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and judas
fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.
the fall could have been before or after death as either would fit this
explanation. this possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the
valley of hinnom is examined. from the bottom of the valley, you can see
rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.
there are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.
therefore, it is easy to conclude that judas struck one of the jagged rocks on
this way down, tearing his body open. db...
now truthfully, i do not see what is comforting about matthew confusing the
source of the potter's field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is
correct: matthew does make that confusion. of course a biblical inerrantist
who claim that every word of the bible is guaranteed true by god, will have to
thereby add one more contradiction to the death of judas (ie: where the
prophesy of the potter's field came from).""
my reply...
please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss
this with you.
db...
as to your second question mr decenso, you ask how we could be sure that the
money with which judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather
than some other source. i would point out that in acts, where it specifically
mention ""the reward of iniquity"" acts 1:18 , it also specifically mentions
what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: acts 1:16 ""...concerning
judas who was guide to those who arrested jesus.""). now i would point out
that when the bible describes an act of ""iniquity,"" and then immediately
discusses "" the reward of iniquity,"" it would be rather inane to suggest that
it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.""
my reply...
dave, we are getting somewhere, aren't we!
act 1:15 and in those days peter stood up in the midst of the disciples
(altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said,
act 1:16 ""men and brethren, this scripture had to be fulfilled, which the holy
spirit spoke before by the mouth of david concerning judas, who became a guide
to those who arrested jesus;
act 1:17 ""for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.""
act 1:18 (now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and
falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.
act 1:19 and it became known to all those dwelling in jerusalem; so that field
is called in their own language, akel dama, that is, field of blood.)
act 1:20 ""for it is written in the book of psalms: 'let his dwelling place be
desolate, and let no one live in it'; and, 'let another take his office.'
notice that in verse 16, the word ""iniquity"" is not used. rather, it states
that judas ""became a guide to those who arrested jesus"".
but the writer did not stop there...vs. 17, ""for he was numbered with us and
obtained a part in this ministry."" what part did judas play in their ministry? joh 12:6 this he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a
thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it.
joh 13:29 for some thought, because judas had the money box, that jesus had
said to him, ""buy those things we need for the feast,"" or that he should give
something to the poor.
so, now we know what part judas played - he was a treasurer, per se.
right after peter stated that judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer,
according to john), then luke adds the parenthetical explanation of ""wages of
iniquity"" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen
by judas to purchase a field. i believe this is a better exegetical
explanation of what the ""wages of iniquity"" are. what do you think, dave?
db...
""now since i have given you clear answers (and even references), perhaps you

82813.eml,talk.religion.misc,"i abhor publishing trash (i abhor it of myself even more than i do from
others, but since i do not present myself as an authority on the subject, i do
not feel dishonest, though i do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in
this example). thus i felt honor bound to do a better set of research
specifically on the word. first it should be noted that greek grammar is not
as tough as i first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and i still am
not competent with it, but it is not as opaque as i had thought). it turns
out that while the index for the bauer-arndt-gingrich ""greek lexicon"" renders
each verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical
order. thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is
far from clear. on the other hand, a greek-english intralinear bible makes
things a lot more comprehendable. and yes, the word for field in acts 1:18 is
indeed ""chorion.""
now i've checked several greek-english lexicons:
""greek english lexicon of the new testament,"" louw and nida
""robinson's greek and english lexicon of the new testament""
""greek english lexicon of the new testament,"" grimm
""word study concordance,"" tynsdale
""a greek english lexicon of the new testament and other
early christian writings,"" bauer-arndt-gingrich
""the new analytical greek lexicon,"" perschbacher
in each case the meaning of the word chorion was given variously as:
a space, place, region, district, field, area, ""country place,""
land, farm, estate, ""a bit of tillage"", and similar meanings.
nowhere do any of these books mention anything about ""grave."" as some of these
books go into great detail, i would be very surprised to find that these books
are all inadequate and mr archer is the only competent scholar in greek. i
think it more likely that mr archer's investigations into ""contradictions"" to
be once again, as your friend said it, ""lacking in substance,"" and thus archer
is again shown worthless as an expert witness (by the way mr decenso, i would
have honorably presented my results on this matter, even if i had found them
to support mr archer's contentions).
by the way, among these lexicons, (eg: robinson's) is the definition of
""agros,"" the word used in matthew 27 to describe the field bought. the word
""agros"" is defined as ""a field in the country."" chorion is specifically noted
as a synonym to agros. this is significant, as it is evidence of how silly
bullinger's exegisis was, which stated that the word for ""field"" in matthew
(ie: agros) is different from the word for ""field"" in acts (ie: chorion), and
thus we must be talking about two different fields (of course you already
admit how stupid bullinger's exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity
which drives the point home).
so as of now, unless mr decenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise
(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), i consider this
particular issue closed. see mr decenso, now you can go on to answer
questions about the denials of peter, the day of the crucifixion, tyre, and
the fact that the author of matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in
discussing the ""potter's field.""

actually, if you do further research as to the greek word ""apacgw,"" you will
find that it does denote success. those scholars did indeed have an excellent
reason to assume that the suicide was successful. as i pointed out, i
recently checked several lexicons:
""greek english lexicon of the new testament,"" louw and nida
""robinson's greek and english lexicon of the new testament""
""greek english lexicon of the new testament,"" grimm
""word study concordance,"" tynsdale
""a greek english lexicon of the new testament and other
early christian writings,"" bauer-arndt-gingrich
""the new analytical greek lexicon,"" perschbacher
a couple simply stated ""hanged oneself"", and a couple were more explicit
and stated that ""apacgw"" means specifically ""kill yourself by hanging."" a
couple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for ""apacgw"" is
""strangle, throttle or choke"" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who
suggested to david joslin that judas was hung upside down). one of the best
references though, ""robinson's greek and english lexicon of the new
testament,"" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the
literal translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also
other presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give
further context).
the word ""apagchw"" has two root words: ""gchw"" is the ""to strangle"" root, and
the root word ""apo"" means literally ""away."" this root words is included in
words which denote a transition. it can mean a transition in place (eg: the
greek word ""apagello"" means to send a message). ""apo"" can also denote a
change in state and specifically the change from life to death. robinson
specifically makes comparison to the word ""apokteiuo,"" which means ""to kill.""
in literal meaning the word ""apacgw"" means ""to throttle, strangle to put out
of the way,"" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from
life, to death). so while the word ""apacgw"" does mean ""to hang,"" it
specifically denotes a death as well. thus robinson is quite specific when he
state that it means ""to hang oneself, to end one's life by hanging."" he then
notes the the use of ""apacgw"" in homers odessy 19:230 to denote context. he
presents that example of ""apacgw"" as being used to explicitly mean ""suicide by
hanging."" now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the
added denotation of ""death,"" and as you insist that the bible was written by
god, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete
meaning of ""apacgw"" (ie: since the word ""apacgw"" was used, then death is
denoted as the result).
by the way, i note that mr decenso also presents an example of ""apacgw"":
note mr decenso, as you say, the septuagint was a translation from hebrew to
greek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the hebrew (ie"" the the
hebrew say ""and died""), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the greek.
it should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added ""and died"", the
correct translation would still be ""apacgw,"" as the man did indeed die from
strangulation (redundant, but correct). further, we have evidence that the
septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions
which contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily
executed by greeks. thus i am not sure that you can use the septuagint as it
now stands, as a paragon of ancient greek. so, what you really need to prove
your point mr decenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing
""apacgw"" and surviving. otherwise i would see you as simply making worthless
assertions without corresponding evidence.
now i would note mr decenso, that everytime i go out of my way to research it
one of your apparently contrived exegisis, i pretty much find it false. thus,
i think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above
what the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit greek or
historical source to justify it.
by the way, as to mr rose's statement about trees around the potter's field:
unless mr rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that
there are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description
of the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to
assert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two
thousand years ago (after all, things change).
now as to your other argument, ie: that the money judas used is not the same
as the 30 silvers:
true, peter (or the author of acts) does not specifically call judas' betrayal
""an iniquity,"" but for that matter, neither does john specifically call judas'
actions ""an iniquity"" either. further john 13:29 did not say that judas took
the money box, but rather said:
""some thought that because, judas had the money box, jesus was telling
him ""buy what we need for the feast""; or that he should give something
to the poor, so after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and
it was night.""
note that it is said that judas left, it does not say that he took the money
box. thus when i see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose
the a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different
book, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by
the author of acts. i find this forced and contrived.
of course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen
evidence that ""apacgw"" means suicide. you see, since judas' hanging was
successful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in john 13:29, because
matthew and mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:
passover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself
the next day. thus the money which bought the ""field of blood"" would have to
have been the 30 pieces of silver (of course he got the 30 pieces of silver
that night as well, and thus couldn't have spent that either. oh dear, i

here's the real problem. americans have become so insensitive to the needs
of others and so completely wrapped up in themselves that they cannot see
straight or think clearly enough to make even the slightest and most obvious
moral decisions based on reality.
if a man abandons a woman to care for their child on her own, he is not
considered to be a very respectable or decent man by anyone. this man has
fled his responsibility, has behaved like a lazy coward, and has turned
away from his responsibility to his wife and child.
however, if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden,
she is not thought of in the same way. when the man abandons, the woman
suffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life.
when the woman abandons, the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumed
out, and the man has no choice, and the man sometimes suffers so badly that
he wishes he could trade places with his child.
ths root of this whole problem is selfishness--the arrogance that says, ""my
feelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung.""
and when you come down to it, this is the substance of what hell is made of.
it's the reason a loving god can throw selfish people to the devil and his
demons for all of eternity. let any one of us unrepentant into heaven, and
we'll ruin it the first chance we get.
: now, i don't really know the answer to these questions, but i've got a real
: good guess.
:
and, it's probably right.
: and i wouldn't call that 'benevolent', either.
:
it is a move in the right direction. as it is now, we don't see our
responsibility because we kill it and get it out of sight. the media
backs us completely. real responsibility does not sell. the only
""responsibility"" that sells in the marketplace is that which is just
enough to make us ""feel responsible"" without showing anything that
might show us our own true irresponsibility. we want to ""feel"" like
good people, but we want nothing with being good people. just give
me the freedom to say ""i'm good"", and the rest of the world can burn.
rape and kill my children and throw my parents to the places where
poor old folks rot until they're dead. i'll hate my brother and sister
if i wish and i'll cheat on my wife or husband. screw the government,
because it screws me, and don't talk to me about giving to the church
because church people are all a bunch of money grubbing hypocrites.
but, i'm a good person. at least i admit what i do. at least i love
myself and we all know that is the greatest love in the world--not that
a man lay down his life for his brother...that sounds too ""christian"".
at the root, this is the substance of what hell is made of.
we've become a self indulgant, backslidden society no longer responsible
to our children, to our parents, to our families, to our government, or
to our god. this is the root behind justification of every evil, of every
corruption in government, of every slanderous remark, of every lie, and
of every murder. society cannot continue to live like this long. it will
have to destroy itsself soon, and perhaps in the end, that will be the
biggest blessing this world can hope to see.
why do people see so much evil in trying to turn this situation around?
""i deplore the horrible crime of child murder...
we want prevention, not merely punishment.
we must reach the root of the evil...
it is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt
from the dreadful deed...
no mater what the motive, love of ease,
or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent,
the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed...

83441.eml,talk.religion.misc,"looking at 1 we find that during roman times ""tyre vied with sidon
for first place in the intellectual life of the period""; that tyre was
the seat of a christian bishop, eventually with 14 dioceses under it;
that ""the most magnificent church of its kind in all phoenecia"" was the
basilica built in tyre ca. 314; that tyre was well known for its
exports of glassware, wine, white marble, and dyed cloth; that tyre,
along with other seaports, ""provided outlets for south arabian, indian
and even chinese trade""; that tyre had to accomodate its growing
population by ""following a perpendicular, rather than horizontal, line
of growth"" (because it was running out of land to build on); that tyre
established colonies of its own. none of this sounds like a ""small
fishing village"" by any stretch of the imagination.
centuries later, under the abbasids, tyre had ""opulent and flourishing
bazaars"" and buildings of 5-6 stories. during this period, tyre was
""noted for its export of sugar, beads, and, as of old, glassware.""
during the crusades, tyre was the second-most flourishing city held
by franks. (there is a lot more, but i got tired of writing.)
in 2 we read the following description of modern lebanon: ""other major cities in lebanon include tripoli, sidon, tyre, baalbek and
zahlah."" my emphasis this source also discusses the impact of
the lebanese civil war, and the israeli military actions (1978, 1982)
on the trading ports of tyre and sidon. it notes that after israel's
withdrawel in 1984, ""tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local
economy.""
if tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present,
why is it always called a city (or, above, a ""major city"")? why
does it show up on all the maps? when population figures for cities
in lebanon are given, why is tyre always one of the cities on the
list (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)? 1 philip k. hitti, lebanon in history: from the earliest times to
the present , ny, st. martins, 1967. 2 federal research division, library of congress, lebanon: a
country study , edited by thomas collelo, 1989.
a one-horse town? sounds like a lot of work for one horse.
(anyway, tyre is connected by roads to the mainland. they
may even use cars these days. :-)
the 1991 encyclopedia britannica says ""pop. (1982 est.) 23,000.""
most other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range.
(one atlas gives the population of tyre as 60,000; the same
source give comparatively high figures for sidon and beirut, also,
so i doubt that it is a typo. perhaps these were figures for
the cities and their surrounding areas.) i don't doubt that the
population of tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades. in
particular, the 1982 israeli military action hurt tyre quite a bit.
i thought you were talking about times that tyre was destroyed.
don't most, if not all, of these apply not just to tyre but to
the other cities in the area? sidon, for example? can you make
a case for tyre having been singled out?
they had a good deal of autonomy under the seleucids. from 2 :
tyre ""receiv ed the rights of autonomy from antiochus ephiphanes
and from 125 bc onward enjoy ed complete autonomy. she started a
large series of coins, occasionally in gold ...""
the descriptions of tyre under the romans don't seem to fit
your characterization, either. and under the abbasids it seems
to have been allowed to flourish. i still think you are stretching

fishing village.

you nor i can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing as

i have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, something
obviously claimed against gays as well. the truth is that unless you are
innately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing. i speak as an

i do not feel threatened by gays, i don't understand why others are.
the following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min-
istries: exodus international homosexuals anonymous.
the founder of an ""ex-gay"" support group chooses homo over hetero
by robert pela (from gay oriented magazine advocate)
in december 1985, david caligiuri received one of the advocate's homophobia rewaa
awards: the a prayer a day keeps the lust away citation. as director of free
indeed, a national ex-gay ministry, caligiuri was singled out for offering
discontented gays and lesbians ""a way out of the homosexual death-style""
through prayer. ""i'd like to give the award back,"" caligiuri now laughs, ""i'm
no longer deserve it.""
caligiuri's eight year involvement with the national ""ex-gay"" movement peaked
with his founding of the phoenix chapter of homosexuals anonymous (ha) as well
as free indeed. he has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex-
gay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception. ""there's no reality
in it,"" he says, ""i was selling a product, and my product was a lie.""
headed up by national ministries like exodus international and courage, the
organizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again
christianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who
are just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their
sexual urges and embracing christianity. ""we offer support to people who are
seeking to leave the sin of homosexuality,"" explains bob davies, director of
exodus. he ventures that ""about 80 of those seeking to abandon their homo-
sexuality are men.""
""anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting
their time,"" says lisa seeley, a former ""redeemed lesbian"" who worked with
caligiuri as ha and appeared with him on the sally jessy raphael show. ""these
organizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded.""
""it's possible to change your identity or your behavior,"" says sex educator
brian mcnaught, author of on being gay . ""but it's really impossible to
change your orientation. these people are no longer calling themselves gay,
but they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings.""
caligiuri says he founded free indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all
hell broke loose in his personal life. a few days after his lover ended both
their romance and their business partnership, caligiuri was sexually assaulted
by a man he picked up in a bar. ""i was really drunk,"" he recalls, ""and i
went home with this guy. he tied me up and raped me. he left me tied up all
night, and the next morning he raped me again.""
when caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the
home he shared with his ex-lover. ""he had another man there with him,""
caligiuri recalls. ""i thought at this time, 'if this is what being gay is
about, i don't want to be this way anymore.""
caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery
with others. he organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at phoenix's
gay pride parade in june 1985, and a few months later free indeed held its
first public protest. at a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance,
free indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed
for hell.
free indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks
in part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages. ""we were listed
under lesbian and gay alternative services,"" caligiuri says, ""so people
thought we were a gay information switchboard. people would call to find out
where the local bars were, and we'd preach to them about the sins of homo-
sexuality."" ruses like this are typical of the movement, caligiuri says,
adding, ""they'll do anything to reach these people.""
""david used to go on radio and say really stupid things,"" recalls peter
kelly, a counselor at phoenix's catholic diocese aids program, ""like that
he knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors.""
caligiuri's family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on
raphael's syndicated talk show in 1985. ""they were relieved,"" he recalls.
""they figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better
that i should be a 'reformed' gay person.""
but caligiuri was hardly reformed. ""by the time i appeared on sally's
show,"" ""i'd started having sex with men again. men would call our hotline
and tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their
father. i was horny all the time.""
unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his
numerous television appearances, caligiuri says he ""used to go to bookstores
and get blowjobs."" when he wasn't working the bookstores, he was sleeping
with other ""reformed"" homosexuals.
""i didn't realize it at first, but a lot of the ha leaders were having sex
with one another,"" caligiuri says. ""we'd go to conferences in other cities,
and we'd be paired up in hotel rooms. everybody was sleeping with everybody
else.""
by the time he appeared on 'am philadelphia' television show in may 1988,
caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week. when the show's
host asked him if he ever ""acted on temptation,"" his answer was a lie.
caligiuri's duplicity began to take it's toll on him, however. he was
suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating
yeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect. ""i was too sick
to go to church,"" he explains. ""the more time i spent away from those people
the more i began to feel like myself. i began to remember who i used to be.""
late in 1991, caligiuri turned free indeed phone lines over to a local
church and closed the ministry's doors. ""i'd convinced myself that there
is no need in the world for ex-gay people,"" he says.
today, caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities (""i'm interest-
ed in belief systems that aren't judgemental.""), considering romance (""but
not with a christian!""), and searching for a new project to devote himself to.
""i feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes,"" he says. ""i want to
eventually stop feeling guilty about what i did and make up for the damage i
may have brought to our community.""
caligiuri's tory is by no means unique and i have read several other articles
of former leaders and founders of 'ex-gay' ministries who have said very similar th
similar things. fortuantely not all of them have left christianity, but have
come to realize that god loves them despite the attitudes of others. some,
like chris glaser, director of the presbyterian ""lazarus project"" of west
hollywood presbyterian church have actually been working with the gay community
to bring them into the sheepfold of christ and encouraging real ethical values
of sexuality within the sphere of being gay. i have also, as i said talked and become
and become close friends with many who once attended such groups as ""love in
action"" and others, who either once claimed to have been ""reformed"" or who
were too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed
in them. some were even encouraged to marry as a way of ""sealing"" their
new heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses
and bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of
night and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous ""sin""
through a committed relationship. this is a horrible trap which the church
has dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno-
cent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages. yet
the church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow
gay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy. this is sad. what is also
mrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and
fear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on
them, they may even opt for 'suicide' or surgical dampering of the brain
functions. in the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common-
place. there are now becoming available more and more literature on the
threat of coercive christianity toward gays, such as sylvia pennington's ""ex-gays? there are none . and others. there are also a great many fact
based books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as
maury johnston's gays under grace , and chris glaser's come hom! . i
seriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and
self-acceptance.
thank you."

truth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise that
produces the desired results.
assuming that there is an absolute morality, two disagreeing
objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right; there
is no room for compromise. once you beleive in absolute morals,
you must accept that you are amoral or that everyone who disagrees

haldeman from his 1991 book homosexuality therapy ineffective
recently the founders of yet another prominent ""ex-gay"" ministry, exodus
international, denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective.
michael busse and gary cooper, cofounders of exodus international and lovers
for 13 years, were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979. the
program was described by these men as ""ineffective . . . not one person was
healed."" they stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent
feelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were
driven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed ""reparative therapy.""
the previous article quoted in the last posting is from the advocate, june
30, 1992 called ""the ex-ex-gay"" by robert pela.
some personal thoughts:
it is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major
portion of the church to control and mandate change of a minority among
its ranks. this was the momentum behind the spanish inquisition, only all
they required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to
save their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death. even
later, the bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and
segragation of african-americans, even to the justification of lynchings.
today's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach. the tool is
still coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind
control, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than
god sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt
thier mind-conditioning is complete. sure, no one is ""physically"" forced
to stay in this ""reparative therapy"" but sheer social pressure is enough for
many to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.
as an abolitionist i advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution
against gays in all facets of civil life. a person should be judged by
the contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live,
not by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven';t
a clue what is in their heart.
for those who seek more information about gays and groups that accept them
please contact your nearest chapter of pflag (parents friends of lesbians
and gays) who will be more than happy to assist you. this is a group of
people comprised of gays, lesbians and bisexuals, their parents and friends
who have formed a support group for help and understanding. try talking to
a parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some ""first-hand"" real life and
loving understanding. god's love and understanding for gay people is no
less abundant.

bediuzzaman said nursi, the risale-i noor
vol 1, no 11, part 1
nineteenth letter
mu'jizat-i ahmediye risalesi
(a treatise on the miracles of muhammad saw)
(saw: peace and blessings be upon him)
in his name (allah) , be he (allah) glorified!
there is nothing but glorifies his (allah's) praise.
in the name of allah, the compassionate, the merciful
""he is who has sent his messenger with
guidance and the religion of truth to make it
supreme over all religion: and sufficient is allah
as a witness. muhammad is the messenger of
allah, and those who are with him are firm
against the unbelievers and merciful among
each other. you will see them bowing and
prostrating themselves, seeking allah's grace
and his pleasure. their mark is on their face
the sing of prostrafion; this is their similitude in
the torah and indgil."" the our'an 48:28-29 since the nineteenth and thirhy-first words
concerning the mission of muhammad (saw) prove his
prophethood with decisive evidences, we assign the
verification of that subject to those words.
as a supplement to them, we will merely show here
in nineteen signs, some of the flashes of that great
truth.
first sign: the owner and master of this universe
does everything with knowledge, disposes every affair
with wisdom, directs everything all-seeingly, treats
everything all-knowingly, and arranges in everything with
his will and wisdom such causes, purposes and uses that
are apparent to us. since the one who creates knows,
surely the one who knows will speak, since he will
speak, surely he will speak to those who have
consciousness, thought, and speech. since he will speak
to those who have thought, surely he will speak to
humankind, whose make-up and awareness are more
comprehensive of all conscious beings. since he will
speak to humankind, surely he will speak to the most
perfect of mankind and those most worthy of address and
highest in morality, and who are qualified to guide
humanity; then he will certainly speak to muhammad (saw),
who, as friend and foe alike testify, is of the highest
character and morality, and who is obeyed by one fifth
of humanity, to whose spiritual rule half of the globe has
submitted, with the radiance of whose light has been
illumined the future of mankind for thirteen centuries, to
whom the believers, the luminous segment of humanity,
renew their oath of allegiance five times a day, for
whose happiness and peace they pray, for whom they call
down allah's blessings and bear admiration and love in
their hearts.
certainly, he will speak to muhammad (saw),
and indeed he has done so; he will make him the
messenger, and indeed he has done so; he will make
him the guide for the rest of humanity, and indeed he
has done so.
to be continued in a allah.

83454.eml,talk.religion.misc,"compare the driver to an urge such as jealousy, where there is an urge
and an ""object"". the jealousy does not technically exist until the object
is apparent. however, the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there
even though it is not detectable.
your description of the unbilical took me three passes to understand (!) but
i get the gist and i have to tentatively agree. i think our two definitions
can sit side by side without too much trouble, though. i haven't attempted to
define the reason behind the moral driver (only hinted through the essence of
each moral). your definition hints that animals are also capable of a
similar morality - simians have a similar social order to ourselves and it is
easy to anthropomorphize with these animals. is this possible or have i
misunderstood?
my p.s. thoughts falls roughly in line with john stuart mill and
his writings on utilitarianism. i have no particular plan (except to do
my bit - personal ethics and social work). my opinion (for what it is worth)
is that the authority for each moral must be increased somehow, and that this
will probably take several generations to be effective. i don't think that the
list of morals has changed for society significantly, though . the authority element
may come from our authority figures and roles models (see eric berne and his
transactional analysis work mavis klein for references) and this is what
gives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.
i've had some more thoughts on my definitions:
i've was thinking that i should add moral character to the list of definitions
in order to get a dynamic version of the moral nature (ie. the interplay of
the moral code and associated authorities). a suitable analogy might be a
graphic equaliser on a hifi system - the moral nature being the set of
frequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes', and the moral character being the
spectrum over time.
conscience is a little more difficult because i can't define it as the
reasoning of a person between actions in the context of his moral nature
because conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often
unwanted. i think conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given
time which compromises one's moral nature. my conscience fits in more with
freud's superego (plus the moral driver) with the stimulous being the
urges or freud's id. the reasoning that i mentioned before is freud's ego,
i suppose. if the moral driver is part of the id then the reason why
conscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. the question is ""what
provides the stimulous to activate the moral driver?"". i think i need some
more time with this one.
that's about it for now!

83457.eml,talk.religion.misc,"yep, that's pretty much it. i'm not a jew but i understand that this is the
jewish way of thinking. however, the jews believe that the covenant between
yhwh and the patriarchs (abraham and moses, in this case) establishes a moral
code to follow for mankind. even the jews could not decide where the boundaries
fall, though.
as i understand it, the sadducees believed that the torah was all that was
required, whereas the pharisees (the ancestors of modern judaism) believed that
the torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of
the required morality in all its nuances (- talmud).
the essence of all of this is that biblical morality is an interface between
man and yhwh (for a jew or christian) and does not necessarily indicate
anything about yhwh outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).
the trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the ""created
in his image"" means. i've heard a number of different opinions on this and
have still not come to any conclusion. this rather upsets the apple cart if
one wants to base a life script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors
unashamedly!) as to living by christ's example, we know very little about
jesus as a person. we only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives
by his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians.
revelation aside, one can only ""know"" christ second-hand or worse.
this is not an attempt to debunk christianity (although it may seem that way
initially), the point i m trying to make is that we only really have the bible
to interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. i guess this is where
faith or relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.
no. there may be an absolute moral code. there are undoubtably multiple
moral codes. the multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral
code. as an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child
may assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told
the child that it is ""wrong"". now, the parent may swear like a trooper in
the pub or bar (where there are no children). the ""wrongness"" here is if
the child disobeys the parent. the parent may feel that it is ""inappropriate""
to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of
animals. the analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that
he is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but
you get the gist of it? incidentally, the young child considers the directive
as absolute until he gets older (see piaget) and learns a morality of his own.

""oh, where is the sea?"", the fishes cried,
as they swam its clearness through."
83460.eml,talk.religion.misc,"i think that you are changing the meaning of ""values"" here. perhaps
it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.
value n. 1. a fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods
or service. 2. monetary or material worth. 3. worth as measured in
usefulness or importance; merit. 4. a principle, standard, or quality
considered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. precise meaning, as
of a word. 6. an assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. mus.
the relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. the relative darkness or
lightness of a color. 9. the distinctive quality of a speech or speech
sound.
in context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. in terms
of scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. note that
these definitions do not mean the same thing.
in my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a
reach. science has its basis in observable fact. even the usages of the
word ""value"" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard
of measurement. i would conclude that science does not have its
basis in values, and so your statement above fails. in fact, if one
concludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on
systems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a
scientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as
""objective values.""
back to the present. this has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow.
just because the word ""values"" is used in both contexts does not mean
that there is a relationship between the two contexts.
if one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must
first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. considering
the meaning of the word ""objective"" i doubt that this will ever happen.
so, back to the original question:
and objective morality is.....?
if you can provide an objective foundation for ""morality"" then that will
be a good beginning.

83484.eml,talk.religion.misc,"superficially a good answer, but it isn't that simple. an awful lot of the
starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic
policies of the western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical
westerner. for instance, some third-world countries with terrible
malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can
be fed to cattle in the us, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers. they
have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans
we encouraged them to take out. fund-raising for ethiopia is a truly bizarre
idea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got.
perhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a western ethic against
western infanticide. all the evidence suggests that so long as the children
are dying in the third world, we couldn't give a shit. and that goes for the
supposed ""pro-life"" movement, too. they could save far more lives by
fighting against third world debt than they will by fighting against
abortion. hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save more
of those by fighting for human rights in china.
and besides, suzanne's answer implies that non-western countries lack this
ethic against infanticide. apart from china, with its policy of mandatory
forced abortion in tibet, i don't believe this to be the case.

templi orientis. kellner had traveled widely in the east, where he
met three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.
kellner's efforts to develop the order were later assisted by franz
hartmann, heinrich klein and theodore reuss, who had worked together
prior to joining the o.t.o. the order was first proclaimed in 1902
in reuss's masonic publication, 'oriflamme'. on kellner's death,
reuss succeeded him as outer head o.h.o. . the 'jubilee' edition of
the 'oriflamme', published in 1912, announced that the order taught
secret of sexual magic.
""theodore reuss was an interesting character. born june 28, 1855 in
augsburg, he entered masonry in 1876. he was a singer, journalist and
possibly a spy for the prussian political police, infiltrating the socialist
league founded by karl marx's daughter and her husband. reuss was
later associated with william wynn westcott, a leader of the golden
dawn, who later introduced him to john yarker. yarker chartered reuss to
found the rites of memphis and mizraim in germany. after several
attempts to concretize various masonic rites, reuss settled on the
development of the o.t.o.
""the order experienced reasonably steady growth under reuss' leadership.
for example, he chartered papus in france, rudolph steiner in berlin
and h. spencer lewis in the usa. in 1912, the historic meeting between
reuss and crowley occurred. crowley wrote that reuss came to him and
accused him of revealing order secrets. when crowley looked at it afresh,
the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for
the first time. reuss appointed crowley as supreme and holy king of all
the english speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked
when publishing the material of the equinox.
""reuss resigned as outer head of the order in 1922 after suffering a
stroke and named crowley his successor. all was well until 1925 when the book of the law was translated into german. there was a break
in the continuity of the order. manyk members split with the new o.h.o.
over the book, which crowley was actively promulgating through the order.
he had earlier revise dthe order rituals at reuss's request, deeply
infusing the doctrines of the new aeon revelation."" an introduction to the history of the o.t.o. , by ad veritatem ix'
within equinox iii:10 , edited by
hymenaeus beta, frater superior, rex summus sanctissimus,
caliph of the united states of america,
published by samuel weiser, 1990.
there are many possible reasons that our frater superior included this
material in equinox iii:10 . and this is the real point, is it not?
why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own
organization? does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle
of thelema? or is he exercising his true will and putting forth very
complex pictures with no easy answers? a picture which leaves room
for very many interpretations.
it is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of o.t.o. derived
out of the dribble of faltering masonry, purchased by clever hucksters
with an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them. and i
can take that all the way down to our present caliph, whose feeble
support of the 'law of thelema' is laughable at best.
would i be thrown out of the order for speaking in this way?
will i?
i think not.
why? because my frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection
i am using as an example. my illustration shows that we may express things
in the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be
quite difficult to apprehend at first.
so it may be with oto and merlinus x'. please look o.t.o. more carefully.
i do not support reuss's words myself, as i am not qualified to assess
them, and i am critical of their pomposity. if i who am a member of
the order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then
what can this say about the health of the order? does it mean that
the order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles? or
does it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of
universal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic
requirement? how shall we resolve these two possibilities?
i find a high calibre of individual associated with ordo templi orientis.
they are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane
or usual information. they are quite often artists and geniuses.
having met some 20 longstanding members in the sf bay area (many who are or
were very heavily involved with the order), i can vouch for the integrity
of the organization as it stands.
i have sometimes questioned the policy of hymenaeus beta. in these moments
i followed my intuition, and i've found little to stop me from requesting
a second initiation from a different o.t.o. body. i'm happily participating
in social groups (feasts or initiations) and have come to know the gnostic
mass well enough for my tastes.
this doesn't make me an authority on order politics and explanations, however.
i can only hypothesize and relay to you what i understand based on my
limited contact with other members.
i urge you not to take the words of merlinus x too far. there are many
ways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with
the order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom
and the preservation of individual vision.
i welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response
to other posts in this thread.
invoke me under my stars. love is the law, love under will.
i am i!

distinguishing among the religious jews, you've excepted the messianic
for obvious reasons. specifically, are you saying it's these religious
jews, who trace their lineage back to abraham by blood and orthodoxy,
rather than by faith, who won't agree? orthodox jews?
as to the a a (if i understand your direction), the issue remains
unproven i suspect, considering how atheists and agnostics so often
look to reason. atheist, it is reasonable to conclude will not agree.
for agnostics, a poll seems in order. who knows? myself, i'm not so
sure the atheists can be counted out.
for the orthodox, i wonder how many would follow moses, or abraham,
or david in accepting god's word? is the particular covenant to which
one adheres, more important than god promisimg? i reckon for many it
depends on the ongoing dialogue. under these considerations, you might
understand why i think it's premature to assert who will and won't agree."

83523.eml,talk.religion.misc,"muhammad peace and blessings of allah be upon him (saw)
is the last prophet of islam. he is the prophet who is revealed
the last holy scripture, qur'an, by allah swa (all praise be to him)
through the arch angel gabriel. he is the seal of all prophets
till the day of judgement as stated in the qur'an by allah
swa (all praise be to him). muhammad saw lived between
571-632 ac. all other prophethoods claimed after muhammad saw,
is a treason against islam, against qur'an, against the message
of allah swa. muhammad saw is from the seed of ishmael, another
messenger of allah and son of abraham also a messenger of allah.
he is the messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his
coming. the above mentioned verse from the qur'an is from
chapter 33, verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:
muhammad is not the father of any of your men,
but (he is) the messenger of allah, and the seal
of the prophets, and allah has full knowledge of
all things.
commentary on the above verse: when a document is sealed,
it is complete, and there can be no further addition. the
holy prophet muhammad saw closed the long line of messengers.
allah's teaching is and will always be continuous, but there
has been and will be no prophet after muhammad saw. the later

mu'jizat-i ahmediye risalesi
(a treatise on the miracles of muhammed saw)
(continued from droplet vol 1, no 11, part 1)
second sign: the noble messenger (saw)
declared his prophethood, and presented to humanity a
decree as the glorious qur'an and manifest miracles
which number, according to the scholars, one thousand.
the occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as
certain as the fact that he declared himself prophet. in
fact, as a shown by the words of the most obstinate
unbelievers quoted in various places of the wise
our'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of his
miracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(allah forbids)
sorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their
followers. the miracles of muhammad (saw) have the
certainty of confirmation by consensus of ulema (scholars
of islam) to the hundreth degree.
the miracle is the conformation by the creator of
the universe of his declaration of prophethood; it has the
effect of the words,'you have indeed spoken the truth !'
suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler,
while being observed by him, 'the true ruler has
appointed me to such and such position. 'at a time when
you were asked to prove your claim, the word 'yes'
uttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you. or, if
the ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your
request, this would confirm your claim even more soundly
and more definitely than would the word 'yes.'
in the same way, allah's most noble messenger
claimed: 'i am the envoy of the creator of this
universe. my proof is that he will change his unbroken
order at my request and my prayer. now look at my
fingers: he makes them run like a fountain with five
spigots. look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, he
splits it in two. look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear
witness to me, it moves and comes near to me. look at
this food: although it is barely enough for two or three
men, it satisfies two or three hundred. 'further he shows
hundreds of similar miracles. however, the evidences of
the veracity of this high being and the proofs of his
prophethood are not restricted to his miracles. all his
deeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral
conduct and manners, his character and appearance
prove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness.
indeed, many people such as abdullah b. salam, the
famous scholar of the children of israel, came to belief
merely by seeing him, and said, 'no lie can hide in this
face, nor can any fraud be found in it!'
although many of the researchers have concluded
that the proofs of the prophethood of muhammad and his
miracles number about one thousand, there are
thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs of
his prophethood. and hundreds of thousands of
truth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions
have affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of
ways.
the wise our'an alone demonstrates thousands of
the proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty
aspects of miraculousness. since prophethood is as a
phenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of
individuals who claimed prophethood and performed
miracles have lived and passed away; then, the
prophethood of muhammad (saw) is of a certanity
superior to that of the prophethood of all the others. for
whatever evidences, qualities and attributes became the
means of the prophethood and messengership of all the
messengers such as jesus (as) and moses (as), they
are all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive
fashion by muhammad (saw). and since the causes and
means of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the
person of muhammad (saw), this authority is to be found
in him with more certanity than all the other prophets.
to be continued allah willing.

83528.eml,talk.religion.misc,"stop! hold it! you have a few problems here. official history says that
the first accusations of homosexuality in the sa came from outside of the nazi
party, long before the nazis ever came to power. so this objection is a red
herring, even if established history is wrong on this point. moreover, none of
the histories i've read ever made mention of hitler or anyone else ever using
homosexuality as a pretext for purging roehm. a point i saw reiterated was that
hitler and the party covered up these accusations. if you are going to accuse
official history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts
right. the pretext for purging roehm was that he was planning to use the sa in
a coup against hitler. nowhere is there mention of using allegations of
homosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it
is possible that the histories i've read have not mentioned this, but i doubt
it - would it be in hitler's best interest to admit to the world that his
former right hand man was a homosexual?).
anyway, as i said before, it is always possible that i have missed references
to the nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the sa after the
night of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. even
the nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. in any case,
this does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the sa during the
1920's.
ah, yes. i forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. i can smell the
paranoia from here. since the nazis never officially charged roehm with
homosexuality (at least, not according to what i've read), i'd like to know
what tainted ""evidence"" you are talking about. since the accusations were made
by persons outside of the nazi party, long before it came to power, and those
accusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in germany in the
1920's and 30's, just how would it be possible for the nazis to go back in
time and plant ""tainted"" evidence? how exactly does one doctor newspapers
which were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being
obvious? what actual incidences of nazi doctoring evidence on this matter
do you know about? and what about the testimony of people who were involved in
these matters, some of whom were not nazis? and what is the point of making a
false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? since the point
here seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof
falls on the revisionist. the revisionists had better do their homework
before making accusations. otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.
this is just about the only thing we agree on.
i suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - roehm and
his sa buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. the feeling
seems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this
must be an attempt to bash homosexuals. this fear - often justified - is what
lies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. but this
is not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. if
you really think that historians are so incompetent, why don't you write them
and ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can't tell from
their footnotes? i'm a graduate student in history. writing to professors and
tracking down sources is old hat. but my time is limited and this is not my
specialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would
cast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. i'm not going to waste my time
trying to debunk someone's paranoia. do the research yourself.
given that you already consider all evidence ""tainted"", what on earth would
constitute concrete particulars? and since when have concrete particulars been
considered ""shrewd guesses""?
i suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (irving et al) -
historians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious
footnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually
provide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. this is the place
to start looking. assuming that one really wants to know the truth.
i'll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already. my
apologies - we seem to have gone off on a bit of a tangent. i forget which gods

83529.eml,talk.religion.misc,"i think the passage you're looking for is the following.
matthew 5:17 ""think not that i have come to abolish the law and the
prophets; i have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them.
matthew 5:18 for truly, i say to you, till heaven and earth pass away,
not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished.
matthew 5:19 whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments
and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he
who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of
heaven.
matthew 5:20 for i tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of
the scribes and pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
there are several problems with this. the most serious is that the
law was regarded by jews at the time (and now) as binding on jews, but
not on gentiles. there are rules that were binding on all human
beings (the so-called noachic laws), but they are quite minimal. the
issue that the church had to face after jesus' death was what to do
about gentiles who wanted to follow christ. the decision not to
impose the law on them didn't say that the law was abolished. it
simply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to gentiles. this
is a simple answer, which i think just about everyone can agree to.
(a discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded
in acts 15.)
however there's more involved. in order to get a full picture of the
role of the law, we have to come to grips with paul's apparent
rejection of the law, and how that relates to jesus' commendation of
the law. at least as i read paul, he says that the law serves a
purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded. again, this
issue isn't one of the abolition of the law. in the middle of his
discussion, paul notes that he might be understood this way, and
assures us that that's not what he intends to say. rather, he sees
the law as primarily being present to convict people of their
sinfulness. but ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one that
has been superceded by christ. paul's comments are not the world's
clearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading. but the
interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does
not entail an abolition of the law. it still remains as an
uncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.
for its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not be
relaxed. however for christians, it's not the end -- ultimately we
live in faith, not law.
while the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the
end i think jesus and paul come to a rather similar conclusion. the
quoted passage from mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest
of the sermon on the mount, where jesus shows us how he interprets the
law. the ""not an iota or dot"" would suggest a rather literal reading,
but in fact that's not jesus' approach. jesus' interpretations
emphasize the intent of the law, and stay away from the ceremonial
details. indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude
towards the sabbath and kosher laws. some scholars claim that mat
5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st cent. jewish
discussions. jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a
tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that
really matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and
plates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who
use them are full of extortion and rapacity. (mat 23:23-25) this, and
the discussion later in mat 5, suggest that jesus has a very specific
view of the law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the
law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.
paul's conclusion is similar. while he talks about the law being
superceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the
""ceremonial law"", such as circumcision and the sabbath. he is quite
concerned about maintaining moral standards.
the net result of this is that when paul talks about the law being
superceded, and jesus talks about the law being maintained, i believe
they are talking about different aspects of the law. paul is
embroiled in arguments about circumcision. as is natural in letters
responding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the
law that is currently causing trouble: the law as specifically jewish
ceremonies. he certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards
of conduct. on the other hand, when jesus commends the law, he seems
to be talking the law in its broadest implications for morals and
human relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later
to give paul so much trouble.
it's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but
we should be familiar with that from current conflicts. look at the
way terms like ""family values"" take on special meaning from the
current context. imagine some poor historian of the future trying to
figure out why ""family values"" should be used as a code word for
opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the u.s. i
think law had taken on a similar role in the arguments paul was
involved in. paul was clearly not rejecting all of the jewish values
that go along with the term ""law"", any more than people who concerned
about the ""family values"" movement are really opposed to family
values."

83547.eml,talk.religion.misc,"i read your post, it was nothing new, i had seen much the same in other
typical""christian"" anti-gay sentimental literature. gay people are and will
con- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates. you may
be unaware of all the statistica ""findings"" concerning african-americans that
have been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias
against african-americans. we usually think of the kkk in these instances,
but there are many other groups. of course, the vast majority of the public
scoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case.
fortunately african-americans had ""whites"" who supported their 'cause' and
public sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around. there was
even a civil war, and anti-negro sentiment increased. in fact, until laws
were put in place to protect the inalienable rights of blacks it was pretty
much legal to discriminate against them.
i know many gays and i will not turn my back on them or their right to be free
form discrimination. you may think that i have been deceived or something,
that is your perogative. my church, christian church (disciples of christ)
openly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society,
including gays. we believe the gospel message of preaching to all creation
and making disciples. we believe in the lord's great commandment to love,
and we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular
to do so. i really like my church for last reason the most. i can find a
church almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the gospel and believes
in the commandment of love (though i'm hard-pressed to find many who actually
sho love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially
within their own community. i may have lost face with the greater christian
community for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists
against the oppression of african-americans. many were even killed and
treated as runaway slaves for being ""nigger-lovers"" and such. i guess i've
decided the challenge is worth it.
in my talks with gay men and women i have heard tragic story after tragic
story centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight
who have been hurt in the process, etc. funny thing is, i don't know of one
case where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject
their gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they
began to take part in some form of support group, like pflag.
i'm apalled by the legislation which passed in colorado, and am equally out0
raged that such slimey people as louis sheldon (from the tradition values
coalition) have been actively working in the christian underground to garner
support within several (8 i believe) states this coming november for more
oppressive legisation against gays.
perhaps you don't get it, and maybe you never will. many didn't get it in the
middle ages and the proclaimed god's will be done as they massacred thousands
in witch hunts and inquisitions.
the message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay
rights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even
hatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn't change
the results). the major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the
final effect of posts like that of yours and mr. hudson is that you have a
""conditional"" love for gays. condition: change and we'll love you. this is
sure strange coming from a group who claim that god has an ""unconditional""
love, one that calls people ""just as they are."" sure there are things that
will 'naturally' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that
need to be changed through some sort of therapy. but then there are things
like left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is
going to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to ""other
people's expectations."" in the process this coerced conformity causes many
people a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have
nothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their
own sense of pseuper-spirituality.
this is sad, but i thoroughly believe that one day it will change. it may be
unpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with
something very personal like 'sexuality' (a taboo subject even today), but i
firmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation
on thier bedrooms. it's funny that most straight people have successfully
removed restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation,
but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it
helps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society.
gay people are not criminals.
another interesting thing happened recently. a very prominent charismatic
church in the silicon valley (here) had two of it's pastors arrested for self-
admitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys). this had apparently
been going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were
voluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so i imagine that
was how they managed to downplay it in the media. how could such a thing
happen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry? one of my friends
recently told me he was ""approached"" by someone who is going through the
reparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for
dinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.
these are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and
creating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not
the call of the christian community. the results of the passing amendment in
colorado has created an organization who's posters are appearing all over
colorado called ""s.t.r.a.i.g.h.t."" (i forget the whole definition off hand,
but the last part was against immoral gross homosexual trash) and their motto
is ""working for a fag-free america"" with an implicit advocation for violence.
this is sick, and it seems to be what you and mr. hudson, and others are
embracing.
we christians have a loooooooooong tradition of coersion and oppression
towards those we feel don't 'measure up', and constant beratement from
organizations like the christian research institute, while they do have a good
purpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of
excluding people.
the gospel i believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to ""include""
people. i have several of dr. martin's books and find them quite helpful,
especially concerning 'cults.' but it seems that cri, has become a cult unto
itself. why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people
to jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away?

then as you understand it, what is it?
yes. i agree with that. but what does that have to do with jesus?
punishment you say? jesus did not regard his death as punishment.
good. i wouldn't either--not the way you understand it.
ask jesus himself. he himself said why in john 12:23-32. it
isn't a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for
a persuasive argument. read jesus's own reply to your
question.
jesus gives more reasons in john 16:7. but one obvious reason
why jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with
his punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that
we would ""stop doubting and believe"" (john 21:27). the fact
that jesus rose from the dead is my hope that i too will rise
from the dead. it is an obvious point. do not overlook it.
without this obvious point, i would have no hope
and my faith would be vanity.
why did jesus suffer in his death? again, ask jesus. jesus
says why in john 15:18-25. that's no mystery either. ""the
world hates him without reason."" it is a direct proclamation
of how far we humans botch things up and thus, how much we
need a saviour.
and why can't you, brian k., accept this? how can you? ""the
world cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows
him."" (john 14:17). the animosity and the lack of knowledge
that comes out in your twistings of robert's daily verses is
very convincing testimony of the truth of john 14:17 and 16:25.
i pray and hope that i do blurt out such animosity and lack of
knowledge. i am not perfect either. but regardless of that, i thank
god that jesus revealed himself to me, without whom i'd also be
bumbling about blindly though arrogantly slandering the very

middle east - date palms - oh, never mind) but apparently acceptable,
on a steaminess level, to be accepted as part of the canon. from
this fact i derive that erotica itself is not incompatible with
catholic doctrine.
is there such a thing as catholic erotica? not necessarily a love
story between people of that faith, but a love story that is not
exploitative, does not seek redemption through penis size, pays
proper respect to the dignity of each partner, and is still erotic
enough to have a place on a.s.s.

most of the journal entries , and rings i and ii .
i would guess that your aim is to cut down on the pornography and
increase the erotica. i actually agree with you that nearly all of

the impression i got from talking with livingston was that the coming
of the lord, power-wise, is going to be something that those who are
unprepared can't handle -- kinda like overloading a fuse -- due to
guilt. somehow it seems to also apply to the entire physical world as
we know it. lf suggests that god doesn't want that and has sent koresh
as a reminder.
seems that those who have been purified through salvation, or that those
protected by the seals, will be the ones who survive. and no -- i don't
have a good idea yet what ""being shielded by the seals"" actually involves
or how exactly it relates to salvation. (other than it involves the
marriage of the bridegroom and the bride... for those of you biblical
well versed.)
- -
me personally, i'm totally 100 dependent on god through christ, so
if god wants me to understand, good. if not, also good. if god wants
to save me, or dispose of me, that's great either way. being born in
the spirit, means being part of the body of christ (ephesians 2), so
who and what i was, matters little. what's important is loving god come nova, nuke, or apocalypse -- who cares? satan might even be able
to pull off a pretty convincing fake. big deal. not worth fearing or
worrying about though, not before:
- the greater glory of god -
maybe koresh is right, maybe he isn't, and it should be interesting to
see the new message (or prophecy). the tour of the bible i've taken in
studying the passages he points to in the 3-02 text, has been most re-
warding. but the test of prophecy is still the fruit it bears -- which
is not yet clear.
much much more important is ""charity"" -- which by definition is --
love for god

you are merely expressing ""approval"" of the consequences i find therein.
which says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my
(or any) religion. ""love"" is a highly ambiguous word, of which christians
can write both the ""gentle"" words paul uses of it in 1 corinthians -- in
a passage that even the ""conservatives"" will quote at you :-) -- and the
words of t. s. eliot in his pentacost hymn, ""love is the unfamiliar name
that wove the intolerable shirt of flame ...""
this is in any case rather to the side of what i was attempting to raise
in my note, as will become more evident below.
blechhh. i think you are misreading me, rather seriously. though,
given my principle that one cannot force one's own notion of ""sin"" on
another, and my unshakeable ""disestablishmentarianism"", russel turpin
and others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my
legislating my own understanding of christian love.
you misread. i can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of
accusation against the inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form
as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human
beings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) ""god""
in near succession. please go back to my quoted words above:
the ""possibility that always exists"" is that i (or, to revert to proper
time sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could
persuade ""christian b"" of my case that the inquisition does indeed
constitute an egregious violation of the law of love. i must also note
that the majority of christians have been so persuaded. by christian
argumentation, as well as by secular both christian and non-christian prohibitions.
what mr. turpin alludes to is a trickier point:
a. i demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved
in the inquisition.
b. the inquisitor responds that mother church must, however
painful this seems , ""discipline"" her children for their
own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or
if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example
""deterring"" others from the same loss-of-soul.)
a. i point out that this ""justification"" of a failure in love
depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of
philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.
b. burns me at the stake.
my rhetoric has failed, but the point i am making is sustained. what is
going on here has a lot to do with ""cultural baggage."" in this case,
the baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief
that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most
believable if taken under torture. the elimination of inqisitorial
practice (in those places where it has been eliminated, or at least
greatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion
of sin in the exchange between a and b.
mr. turpin is pointing out that, if i am a versus the grand inquisitor's b,
then my persuasion is not very likely to work. i know this; and in what-
ever personal agony, i consign the issue to god and my ghostly defense
attorney. so, ""one possibility"" fails in this case -- as it will fail in
may others. at the other extreme, the ""persuasion"" will succeed when it
properly should not, if it entails mistaken assumptions i share with the
inquisitor. and that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that
many of the victims of inquisition will have ""accepted"" that they were in
fact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty
of charges brought against them.)
the point is that the ""persuasion"" breaks down when the parties do not
share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main
thrust of the inquisition, against ""heresy"", it is bound to break down
in precisely the ""worst"" cases. the ""conservative"" (i don't think that
is the right word, btw) will take refuge in what i attribute to b above,
that he is ""justified"" in causing harm because he thinks that works to
a ""greater good."" but this is a violent and extravagant refusal to follow
the gospel, as if one's theories about ""sin"" entitled one to cast aside
jesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. matthew 5:39ff).
i am a ""radical"" christian only in that i take the gospel seriously.
well, the whole point of making these the ""base"" commandments is that
they aren't reducible to rules. a set of rules is a moral code or a
law code or an algorithm for acting. such things can be very helpful
to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used instead of a
personal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions. the great
commandment is, more than anything else, a call to act as if you were
god and accepting ultimate responsibility in your every action. a
demand that i, like most, would rather not hear, but it keeps popping
up nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important
that i be open to trying this, than succeeding at it). ""conservatives""
may twist this ""act as if you were god"" to mean ""lay down rules for other
people and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep your rules.""
they are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a
lot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy
is how god acts. that, after all, is the standard accusation ""against
god"" by the atheists here and elsewhere. that the ""conservatives"" have
confused their manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other
people with the nature of god is almost the entire content of standard
american atheism -- and i quite agree with it on this point.
and different bodies of christians have, from the beginning, urged different ""ethical systems"" (or in some cases, none). as a result,
it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular
(or infamous) with christianity. christianity does not have a torah.
it does not have a qu'ran. specifically christian scripture has very
little, if anything, in the way of ""commandments"" -- so little that
the ""christians"" who desperately want commandments go ""mining"" for
them with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-))
for their efforts. the one, single, thing in the gospels which jesus
specifically ""gives"" as ""a commandment"" to us is ""love one another."" i will be expanding on this point in a reply to paul hudson
that i hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that
some christians infer lots of commandments from the nt; i'll
point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why
there is a huge amount of ""cultural baggage"" involved. you are quite right that this is ""goo"" if one is looking for an ethical
system.
but why should anyone be looking for an ethical system, since our
society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do? it
may be that we need a principle for the critique of ethical systems
i think you are begging the question. why don't i and the (myriads
of) other christians like me tell you something about christianity? nor is this very new in christianity -- you might want to look up
the origins and fundamental doctrines of the quakers, from the 17th
century onwards, and they are not at all the first to understand the
gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case. michael l. siemon i say ""you are gods, sons of the most high, all of you; nevertheless
- or - you shall die like men, and fall like any prince."" psalm 82:6-7"

83627.eml,talk.religion.misc,": so most bible-studying christians won't be convinced by my arguments?
: and this is supposed to be a good thing, i presume?
where does this ""most bible studying christians think as frank
does"" come from. and what implied ""good"" are you doing for other
christians?
at least some of what you are teaching has been demonstrated as
wrong. has it ever occured to you that you may be doing more harm
than good to your fellow christians?
btw, i used to think like frank does. i went to a fundamentalist
church for a while. i didn't start to really think about what
they were saying until i noticed a ""god's science"" phamphlet
there. i read it and noticed that the authors of it knew virtually
nothing about science. i asked church members some questions about
""theories"" from the phamphlet and got only deceptive answers. i
began to notice a very similar style of ""answers"" for theological
questions as well. the only conclusion i could reach was that
these peoples' beliefs about the bible were about as valid as
their beliefs in their god's science phamphlet.
: if there are still people out there who think that my purpose here
: is to ""attack the bible,"" (an accusation frank once made) i would point
: out that i have also criticized people who have posted ""bible
: contradictions"" that turn out to be silly, out of context, or easily
: (and legitimately) reconciled. i'm not attacking the bible, but
: intellectual dishonesty about the bible, from either side.
if one of the primary purposes of christians is to seek out truth,
how can people condemn you for doing this?

83629.eml,talk.religion.misc,"ra (robert weiss) says:
ra ra well, jason, it's heretical in a few ways. the first point is that
ra this equates lucifer and jesus as being the same type of being.
ra however, lucifer is a created being: ""thou wast perfect in thy
ra ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in
ra thee."" (ezekiel 28:15). while jesus is uncreated, and the creator of
ra all things: ""in the beginning was the word, and the word was with
ra god, and the word was god. the same was in the beginning with god.
ra all things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made
ra that was made."" (john 1:1-3) ""and he is before all things, and by
ra him all things consist."" (colossians 1:17)
ra ra your inference from the ezekiel and john passages that lucifer was
ra ""created"" and that jesus was not depends on a particular interpetation of
ra the word ""create"" -- one with which many christians may not agree.
ra granted the mormon belief that all of god's children (including christ
ra and lucifer) are eternally existent intelligences which were ""organized""
ra into spirit children by god, the term ""creation"" can apply equally well
ra to both of those passages.
just briefly, on something that you mentioned in passing. you refer to
differing interpretations of ""create,"" and say that many christians may
not agree. so what? that is really irrelevant. we do not base our faith
on how many people think one way or another, do we? the bottom line is
truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.
also, i find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created
and eternally existent are equivalent, you say ""granted the mormon
belief..."" you can't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to
have been addressed. in order to reply to the issue, you have to address
and answer the point that was raised, and not just jump to the
conclusion that you grant.
the bible states that lucifer was created. the bible states that jesus
is the creator of all. the contradiction that we have is that the lds
belief is that jesus and lucifer were the same.
ra your point that we all are brothers of jesus and lucifer is also
ra heretical, since we are not innately brothers and sisters of christ.
ra we are adopted, ""for ye have not received the spirit of bondage
ra again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby
ra we cry, abba, father."" (romans 8:15); and not the natural children
ra of god. it is only through faith that we even enter the family of
ra god; ""for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus.""
ra (galatians 3:26). and it is only through the manifestation of this
ra faith in receiving jesus that we are become the sons of god. ""but
ra as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of
ra god, even to them that believe on his name: which were born, not
ra of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but
ra of god."" (john 1:12-13)
ra ra has it occured to you, robert, that being ""born of"" someone or being
ra of that person (or person)'s ""family"" may be a symbolic term in the new
ra testament? mormons believe that we are ""adopted"" into the house of
ra israel through baptism and faith in christ, although some have expressed
ra belief that this does evince a physical change in our bodies.
the mormon belief is that all are children of god. literally. there is
nothing symbolic about it. this however, contradicts what the bible
says. the bible teaches that not everyone is a child of god:
the field is the world; the good seed are the children of the
kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one ;
(matthew 13:38)
i speak that which i have seen with my father: and ye do that which
ye have seen with your father. (john 8:38)
ye do the deeds of your father. then said they to him, we be not
born of fornication; we have one father, even god. jesus said
unto them, if god were your father, ye would love me: for i
proceeded forth and came from god; neither came i of myself, but he
sent me. why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye
cannot hear my word. ye are of your father the devil, and the
lusts of your father ye will do. he was a murderer from the
beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in
him. when he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a
liar, and the father of it. (john 8:41-44)
and said, o full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of
the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease
to pervert the right ways of the lord? (acts 13:10)
wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this
world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit
that now worketh in the children of disobedience: (ephesians 2:2)
in this the children of god are manifest, and the children of the
devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of god, neither he
that loveth not his brother. (1 john 3:10)
one becomes a child of god...
but as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the
sons of god, even to them that believe on his name: (john 1:12)
behold, what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us, that
we should be called the sons of god: therefore the world knoweth us
not, because it knew him not. beloved, now are we the sons of god,
and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when
he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he
is. (1 john 3:1-2)
...when he is born again through faith in jesus christ:
which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of
the will of man, but of god. (john 1:13)
having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus
christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
(ephesians 1:5)
of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should
be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. (james 1:18)
for as many as are led by the spirit of god, they are the sons of
god. for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;
but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, abba,
father. the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we
are the children of god: (romans 8:14-16)
beloved, let us love one another: for love is of god; and every one
that loveth is born of god, and knoweth god. (1 john 4:7)
whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god: and
every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is
begotten of him. (1 john 5:1)
for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus.
(galatians 3:26)
ra we are told that, ""and this is life eternal, that they might know
ra thee the only true god, and jesus christ, whom thou hast sent.""
ra (john 17:3). life eternal is to know the only true god. yet the
ra doctrines of the lds that i have mentioned portray a vastly
ra different jesus, a jesus that cannot be reconciled with the jesus of
ra the bible. they are so far removed from each other that to proclaim
ra one as being true denies the other from being true. according to the
ra bible, eternal life is dependent on knowing the only true god, and
ra not the construct of imagination.
ra ra ra robert, with all due respect, who died and left you chief arbiter of
ra correct biblical interpretation? i don't mean to be snotty about this,
ra but the fact is that the bible is so differently interpreted by different
ra groups of biblical scholars (what do you think of the jehovah's
ra witnesses, for example?) that to make reference to the ""jesus of the
ra bible"" is simply ridiculous. whose ""jesus of the bible"" do you mean?
this is really a red herring. it doesn't address any issue raised, but
rather, it seeks to obfuscate. the fact that some groups try to read
something into the bible, doesn't change what the bible teaches. for
example, the fact that the jehovah's witnesses deny the deity of christ
does not alter what the bible teaches ""looking for that blessed hope,
and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour jesus
christ;"" (titus 2:13),""simon peter, a servant and an apostle of jesus
christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through
the righteousness of god and our saviour jesus christ:"" (2 peter 1:1) on the deity of christ.
we first look to the bible to see what it teaches. to discount, or not
even address, what the bible teaches because there are some groups that
have differing views is self-defeating. to see what the bible teaches,
you have to look at the bible.
ra ""our lord's mortality was essential to his own salvation"" ( the
ra promised messiah , p. 456), ""he had to work out his own salvation by
ra doing the will of the father in all things"" (ibid., p.54), ""he had
ra to be baptized to gain admission to the celestial kingdom"" ( mormon
ra doctrine , p.71).
ra ra welcome to the wonderful world of mormon paradoctrine, robert. the
ra above books are by the late bruce r. mcconkie, a former general authority
ra of the lds church. those books were not published by the church, nor do
ra they constitute ""offical doctrine."" they consist of his opinions. now,
ra does that mean that what he says is not true? not at all; i'll have to
ra think about the idea of christ's personal salvation before i come to any
ra conclusions myself. the conclusions i come to may seem ""heretical"" to
ra you, but i'm prepared to accept that.
i find this rather curious. when i mentioned that the mormon belief is
that jesus needed to be saved, i put forward some quotes from the late
apostle, bruce mcconkie. the curious part is that no one addressed the
issue of jesus needing to be saved.' rick comes the closest with his ""i
have my own conclusions"" to addressing the point.
most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of
bruce mcconkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' i don't
think that it matters if mcconkie's views were canon. that is not the
issue. were mcconkie's writings indicative of mormon belief on this
subject is the real issue. the indication from rick is that they may
certainly be. robert weiss"

translation
the vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material
nature. o arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. be free
from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be
established in the self.
purport
all material activities involve actions and reactions in the three
modes of material nature. they are meant for fruitive results, which
cause bondage in the material world. the vedas deal mostly with fruitive
activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of
sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. arjuna,
as a student and friend of lord krsna, is advised to raise himself to
the transcendental position of vedanta philosophy where, in the
beginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme
transcendence. all the living entities who are in the material world are
struggling very hard for existence. for them the lord, after creation of
the material world, gave the vedic wisdom advising how to live and get
rid of the material entanglement. when the activities for sense
gratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the
chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the
upanisads, which are part of different vedas, as the bhagavad-gita is a
part of the fifth veda, namely the mahabharata. the upanisads mark the
beginning of transcendental life.
as long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in
the material modes. one has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities
such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating
such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. this
transcendental position is achieved in full krsna consciousness when one
is fully dependent on the good will of krsna.
